guide.sausage_core.general.introduction.info.0=

§lSausageCore§r is a mod authored by Yaossg, which provides utilities for both players and modders, acting as a dependency for any other mods developed by Yaossg.\nVisit its Github page(WIP) to learn more technical details.

guide.sausage_core.general.introduction.info.1=Why not try my sister mods §dManaCraft§r and §k§6Sausage's Factory§r Series? :)\n§cOpenCapacitor§r is coming soon!\nVisit my Github page(WIP) below to learn more.

guide.sausage_core.general.ingredient.info.0=SausageCore added 2 kinds of Ingredient, which are ItemWildcard and OreFilter.\nMore about this technical part, please visit its Github page(WIP) to learn.
guide.sausage_core.general.ingredient.info.1=§lItemWildcard§r(sausage_core:item_wildcard) is literally minecraft:item, but with no tag of data, so it matches any metadata
guide.sausage_core.general.ingredient.info.2=§lOreFilter§r(sausage_core:ore_filter) matches ore dictionary according to the predicate. Predicates you can use are:\n  - startsWith\n  - endsWith\n  - contains\n  - matches\n  - equals\n  - equalsIgnoreCase

guide.sausage_core.general.world_type.info.0=SausageCore added 2 world types, which are Buffet and CustomSize.\nIn the future a brand new type originally designed by Yaossg is coming.
guide.sausage_core.general.world_type.info.1=§lBuffet§r is minimal (1.13) buffet world, you can select a biome, which covers the entire world.\nIn the customize page, the middle button is used to switch among mods(e.g. If a biome in Mod A is being selected currently, clicking the button will cause the first one in Mod B to be selected).
guide.sausage_core.general.world_type.info.2=§lCustomSize§r is a world type in which you can customize biome size(Default = 4, Large Biomes = 6).

guide.sausage_core.general.debugging.info.0=§l/data§r is modelled after 1.13's but query only, which displays with grammar highlight. Additionally, it works on Players.\nHere is an example: (To display them clearly, I replaced white characters with black ones)\n\n§0{§bName§0: "§aZYL§0", §6Height§0: §61.68§cf§0}
guide.sausage_core.general.debugging.info.1=§lDebug Stick§r is a very handy tool to switch block states, query blocks' states and NBTs and entities' NBTs.\nshift + use in the open air to switch among modes.
