# Colorful Module

![Way too pretty.](item:computronics:modules.tis3d@0)

While active, the Colorful Module continously reads values from all four of its ports. It then sets its color to the value it received.

Colors are defined as a 15-bit binary. The last 5 digits control shades of blue, the middle 5 modify shades of green and the first 5 define shades of red. For instance, the binary representation `000000000011111` (converted to a decimal value) would result in a blue color.
