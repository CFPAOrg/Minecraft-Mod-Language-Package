# Colorful Lamp

![So pretty.](block:computronics:colorful_lamp)

The colorful lamp is a special light block allowing for up to 32768 color combinations. Colors are defined as a 15-bit binary. The last 5 digits control shades of blue, the middle 5 modify shades of green and the first 5 define shades of red. For instance, the binary representation `000000000011111` (converted to a decimal value) would result in a blue color. The colorful lamp could for example be used as a status block, where different colors could represent different states of a program running on the computer.
