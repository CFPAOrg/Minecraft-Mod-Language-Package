# Radar

![Radio Detection and Ranging](block:computronics:radar)

The radar block behaves similarly to the motion sensor in Open Computers, allowing detection of entities such as players, mobs or dropped items. The built in API functions return a table of names and relative distances of entities within the specified range. 

The radar block requires a certain amount of power for scanning larger areas (with Open Computers), or has a delay between scans (ComputerCraft).
