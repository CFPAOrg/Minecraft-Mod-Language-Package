![Popular proper pop propagation](block:computronics:audio_cable)

The Audio Cable allows you to connect devices which send audio signals to devices which receive and process those. An example would be connecting a [tape drive](tape_drive.md) with one or multiple [speakers](speaker.md).

Like most devices, audio cables may be colored using dyes or one of various coloring devices like Paint Brushes you may find in your world. When colored, a cable will not connect to any adjacent cable or audio device that has a different color. Uncolored devices will always be connected to, and uncolored cables will connect to anything.
