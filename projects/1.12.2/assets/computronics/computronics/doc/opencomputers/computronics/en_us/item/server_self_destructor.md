# Server Self-Destructor

![Solid state of the art](item:computronics:oc_parts@11)

Don't you also sometimes think about how messy and dirty your server racks become after a while? Well, the latest invention of Hugging Creeper Industries resolves that problem: The SSD! On command, this marvellous device will, after a specified duration, wipe the containing and any connected [server rack](/%LANGUAGE%/block/rack.md) clean! In fact, they will be so clean you won't even be able to detect the presence of your other mountables anymore while the racks themselves will appear undamaged! Truly ingenious.

Similarly to the [Self-Destructing Card](self_destructing_card.md), this device can be used with the `explode` floppy disk which allows for convenient and highly configurable self-destruction.
