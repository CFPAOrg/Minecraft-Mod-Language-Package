The Digital Signal Receiver Box allows for detecting aspect changes and is connected using a cable on the top or bottom face of the box. Signal aspects are defined as per Railcraft's [signalling](http://railcraft.info/wiki/guide:signalling) documentation (aspects include green, yellow blinking, yellow, red blinking, and red).

The box can be connected to up to 32 different controllers. A controller is referenced by the name given to it using a Signal Label.
