# Rack Capacitor

![I've got the power!](item:computronics:oc_parts@12)

The Rack Capacitor is a [Capacitor](/%LANGUAGE%/block/capacitor.md) that you can put inside a [Server Rack](/%LANGUAGE%/block/rack.md). Its benefits are akin to those of a normal [capacitor](/%LANGUAGE%/block/capacitor.md), however, Rack Capacitors do not get any adjacency bonus.

This Capacitor provides a component called `rack_capacitor` which allows you to read how much energy the capacitor stores at any point in time. This might be useful if you want to check whether your network is having power problems.
