# Speech Upgrade

![WORLD DOMINATION PLANS ARE PROGRESSING.](item:computronics:oc_parts@14)

The speech upgrade can be placed into robots and drones with a tier 2 upgrade slot or higher. The upgrade behaves similarly to the [speech box](../block/speech_box.md), allowing the device it is installed in to talk.
