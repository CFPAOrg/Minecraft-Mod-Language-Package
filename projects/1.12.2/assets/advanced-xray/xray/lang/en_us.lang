xray.message.help.state=Due to a limitation in how 1.12 states work with block variants the\nsimplest way for us to handle them is to provide 2 ways of adding\nnew blocks. You can add a `default` block by using 'Add Block' which will\nadd the basic version of that black or you can use 'Add Looking at'\nwhich will get the block from the world making it that absolute block.\nThis is the most ideal when needing a specific block.

xray.message.help.warning=As a warning, using any distance over 64 will cause FPS drops due\nto the vast amount of blocks that we have to scan. (It's like 256^3)
