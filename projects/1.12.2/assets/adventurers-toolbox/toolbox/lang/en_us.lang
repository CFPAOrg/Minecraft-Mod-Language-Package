guide.page.misc.name=Toolmaking

guide.page.misc.text=The art of toolmaking is highly practicle, and quite simple.|All tools can be made from just a few types of tool parts. There are tool heads, which take many forms, and are specialized for use in a specific tool type. The head of the tool tends to define the tool's basic stats that other parts can then modify. There are also hafts and handles, which can be used to make a variety of different tools, and tend not to have too much of an effect on tool stats. Finally, there are adornments, which are always optional, but can provide noticable benefits to a tool's stats if you decide to add one.|To craft a tool out of the it's requisite parts, simply place all of the parts into a crafting table in any configuration.

guide.mat.blaze_rod.desc=*Tools made with blaze rod hafts will start fires when used on a block, much like a flint and steel.
guide.mat.end_rod.desc=*When a block is mined with a tool made with an end rod haft, any dropped items will have no gravity.
guide.mat.wither_bone.desc=*Tools use eight times as much durability when not in the nether.
guide.mat.prismarine.desc=*Tools made with prismarine are faster when the user is wet.
guide.mat.lapis.desc=*Tools made with lapis lazuli can be enchanted up to level 50 instead of 30. Additionally, mining blocks or killing mobs with a lapis lazuli adorned tool will sometimes grant extra experience orbs.
guide.mat.ender_pearl.desc=*Tools adorned with ender pearls will be able to mine blocks at a slightly greater distance than normal tools.
guide.mat.withered_bone.desc=*Tools made with withered bones will inflict opponents with withering when landing a critical strike. The effect will be more potent if the tool is made with multiple withered bones.
guide.mat.void.desc=*Tools and weapons made with void metal will slowly repair themselves when damaged and inflict weakness upon struck mobs and players. They also tend to warp the mind of anyone who wields them.

guide.tool.hammer.name=Hammer

guide.tool.pickaxe.desc=Pickaxes are used to mine stone and metal-based blocks. A pickaxe is not a great weapon, but can still be used as one in a pinch. They are made with a pickaxe head, a haft, a handle, and optionally an adornment.
guide.tool.axe.desc=Axes are used to break wood-based blocks. They can also be used as weapons, dealing high damage at low speed, with the added bonus of momentarily disabling the target's shield. Axes are made with an axe head, a haft, a handle, and optionally an adornment.
guide.tool.shovel.desc=Shovels are used to break looser ground-based blocks, like dirt, sand, and gravel. They can also be used to turn grass into grass paths. A shovel doesn't make for a great weapon, but is still far preferable to using your fists. Shovels are made with a shovel head, a haft, a handle, and optionally an adornment.
guide.tool.hoe.desc=Hoes are used to till soil into farmland. They do very little attack damage, but have an attack speed that scales with the quality of their materials. This means that a wooden hoe will be very slow, but an iron hoe adorned with a diamond will be quite fast. Even a diamond-adorned iron hoe will only be as good as your fists, however, because all hoes deal just as much damage as your bare hand, and even that hoe's high speed won't be any faster than your fist. Hoes are made with a hoe head, a haft, a handle, and optionally an adornment.
guide.tool.handpick.desc=Hand picks can mine all the same blocks as a pickaxe, but they are slower and less durable than normal pickaxes. They also can't reach blocks quite as far away as a normal pickaxe can. Due to their small size, however, you can be much more precise when mining ores, meaning that hand picks effectively have a Fortune I enchantment built in. This bonus stacks with the Fortune enchantment. As weapons, hand picks are faster than pickaxes, but less damaging. Hand picks are made with a hand pick head, a haft, a handle, and optionally an adornment.
guide.tool.hammer.desc=Hammers can mine all the same blocks as a pickaxe, but they are slower, and they break up to nine blocks at a single time. When mining a block with a hammer, all surrounding blocks of the same type will also be mined. Sneaking disables this ability. As weapons, hammers deal incredible damage at a very low speed. Using one on a block will create a small blast that doesn't damage blocks, but does damage and knock back nearby mobs. This ability deals large amounts of damage to the hammer itself, and also has a cooldown. Hammers are made with a hammer head, a haft, a handle, and optionally an adornment.

guide.weapon.sword.name=Sword
guide.weapon.dagger.name=Dagger
guide.weapon.mace.name=Mace

guide.weapon.sword.desc=Swords are the most basic weapon available. They have average attack speed, decent damage, and can perform a sweep attack if you're moving slowly. They are made with a sword blade, a crossguard, a handle, and optionally an adornment.
guide.weapon.dagger.desc=Daggers are fast weapons that deal low damage. Their short length means you have to get very close to your target if you want to attack. Their range is half that of a sword. Daggers are made with a dagger blade, a handle, and optionally an adornment.
guide.weapon.mace.desc=Maces are blunt weapons that are slightly slower than swords, but do slightly more damage. They cannot perform sweep attacks, but critical strikes will briefly stun the opponent and all attacks have a chance to do extra damage to the target's armor. Maces are made with a mace head, a haft, a handle, and optionally an adornment.
