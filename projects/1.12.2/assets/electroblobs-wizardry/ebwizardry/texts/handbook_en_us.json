In particular, it manifests itself in naturally occurring crystals, which can be found embedded in rocks underground. @wands Wands@ can store mana within them, and this mana is channeled into the @spells@ that you cast. Different spells require different amounts of mana, depending on how powerful they are and how long they last.",

Indeed, this is how the vast majority of mana exists - spread thinly throughout the world. However, to be of any use, it must be concentrated, either naturally over thousands of years, as is the case with crystals underground, or artificially - an advanced subject not covered in this book. There also exist various ways of making spells more mana-efficient and recovering some of the mana dissipated during spellcasting."

				"#image magic_wand",

				"Most wands begin their life as a simple arrangement of a magic crystal of some sort attached to a wooden stick, with a gold nugget affixed to the other end. The crystal is, of course, the source of the wand's power, as it provides the focus necessary to channel @spells@. The rest of the wand is important too though, as it provides not only a means with which to hold the wand, but also a path through which @mana@ can be channeled and directed.",

				"As more spells are cast with a wand, it grows more effective at channeling @spells@, and can therefore cast spells of greater power. This effect can be discerned from subtle changes that occur in the shape and appearance of the wand itself: as a wand grows more powerful, its crystal will become more vibrant,  its colour may change depending on its @elements element@, and after a while, the wood from which it is made will start to grow and twist into more complex shapes.",

				"When holding a wand, a small heads-up display will show in the corner of the screen. This indicates the spell that is currently selected along with a pictorial representation of it, and, if the spell has been cast, a cooldown bar indicating the time until that spell can be cast again. It also shows the names of the next and previous spells bound to the wand. To switch between spells, use the #next_spell_key and #previous_spell_key keys (these can be changed in options -> controls). You can also switch spells by scrolling the mouse wheel while sneaking.",

				"When viewing an inventory, hovering over a wand will display how much @mana@ is stored in it, along with its currently selected @spells spell@ and any specific abilities it may have. More in-depth information about a wand can be viewed by placing it in an @arcane_workbench arcane workbench@."

Spell books can be found throughout the world and it will not take long for you to come across one. When you do find one, you can mouse over the spell book to see basic information about the spell at a glance. You can also right-click whilst holding a spell book to read more about it.",

				"Scrolls, on the other hand, serve a different purpose: right-clicking whilst holding one will cast the spell that is bound to it, destroying the scroll in the process. Like spell books, scrolls can be found throughout the world, but you can also make them yourself (see @enchanting_scrolls Enchanting Scrolls@).",

				"Scrolls are quite useful when you need to use a spell once or twice on a particular quest but don't want it to take up a slot on your @wands wand@. They also have the advantage of being able to instantly cast spells that would normally require a charge-up period. It should be noted, however, that they are an inefficient method of casting spells compared to using a wand.",

				"To the untrained eye, the magical runes with which spells are written are unreadable. In order to identify a spell, you could, of course, cast it and see what happens - though doing so may cause unwanted side-effects, and many spells need certain conditions in order to work. Futhermore, there is always a chance of misreading an unknown spell when casting, with potentially dangerous consequences depending on how powerful the spell is. A safer and more reliable option is to use a scroll of identification, which can be found in chests or purchased from a wizard. Right-clicking whilst holding one will identify the first unknown spell book or scroll on your hotbar, consuming the scroll of identification in the process."

The practice of building them has become much rarer in recent history, mainly because once built, a solid rock altar lasts for centuries, so there is little need for new ones. Instead, most wizards find and repair an existing altar for when they need to perform imbuement rituals - and library ruins are the perfect place to look.",

This does not necessarily mean that they are useless at higher tiers however; their low cost makes some novice spells useful even when you have access to master spells.",

				"#colour_advancedAdvanced #colour_resetwands are quite rare and are much more powerful. They can cast all spells except master spells, and hold #advanced_max_charge mana. Advanced spells can grant superhuman powers such as invisibility and wreak havoc on foes.",

				"#colour_masterMaster #colour_resetwands are the most powerful wands in existence. They hold up to #master_max_charge mana, and can cast any spell. Master spell books are very rare and the spells can cause complete devastation not only to enemies but even the world itself. Use with caution.",

				"#colour_fireFire#colour_reset \nPerhaps the most destructive element, fire concerns burning, lava, and explosions. A powerful pyromancer will unleash hell upon their enemies and probably set the world alight in the process. Most fire attack spells set fire to their target, causing ongoing damage over time. However, be wary that fire spells may have no effect on nether mobs.",

				"#colour_iceIce#colour_reset \nThe element of ice is made of all that is cold. Frost spells often slow enemies down or freeze them completely, and are especially effective on creatures of fire. Frost magic can prove equally useful outside of combat, such as freezing water to cross a river.",

				"#colour_lightningLightning#colour_reset \nThis element concerns lightning, storms, and the weather. A powerful storm mage is a force to be reckoned with, and some posess the ability to call down lightning at will. Lightning spells often damage multiple enemies at once and usually seek their target, making them an effective attack against any mob... but beware of creepers.",

				"#colour_necromancyNecromancy#colour_reset \nNecromancy is the element of darkness, chaos and the undead. Necromancers are mysterious and often regarded as evil, though this is usually not the case. Necromancy spells are commonly used to summon @creatures@ to fight for you or even bend the will of your enemies.",

				"#colour_earthEarth#colour_reset \nThe element of earth is focused on the natural world: animals, plants, the wind, and such like. Earth magic is diverse and takes a wide variety of forms, from poisoning enemies to unleashing the fury of the weather. Earth spells are a mixture of attack, defense and utility.",

				"#colour_sorcerySorcery#colour_reset \nSorcery is the element of force and change. Sorcerers manipulate light, gravity and even reality itself to fit their needs. Sorcery spells can be used, among other things, to grant their caster magical powers or move objects to their will.",

				"#colour_healingHealing#colour_reset \nThe element of healing is concerned with defense and regeneration. Healers seek to protect themselves and their allies as much as possible and as such can be very difficult opponents. Though generally not used as an attack, the purifying light of some healing spells will do considerable damage to the undead. Healing spells are indispensable when in combat.",

				"The boundaries between the different elements are not always distinct, and some spells bear traits of elements other than their own.",

				"If you are lucky, you may happen upon an elemental crystal. Elemental crystals are magic crystals that have absorbed elemental properties as they have grown - though the exact conditions required and mechanism by which this happens remain a mystery. We do know, however, that such crystals may be used to create elemental wands, which allow spells of the right element to be cast with more potency than usual."
