# Research Basics
research.base_energistics.title=Thaumic Energistics
research.base_energistics.stage.1=As both a scientist and an arcane scholar, I have postulated that it must be possible to combine technology and magic in a stable and productive way.<BR>I should study the principals of matter-energy conversion in detail to accomplish this. It is likely there are aspects of Thaumaturgy that can accomplish this, as well as technology capable of doing the same.<BR>This will require extensive study, but I am sure that it will be a worthwhile investment of my time.

# Research Digisentia
research.digisentia.title=Digi-Sentia
research.digisentia.stage.1=Having discovered how to distill essentia, it occurs to me that I may be able store it digitally.<BR>Examining the §lFormation Core§r and §lAnnihilation Core§r I realize that with some minor modifications they could serve as a means to convert essentia to and from a digital format.<BR>However, due to the corrosive nature of certain types of essentia, a layer of quicksilver around the circuitry is required to prevent decay.
research.digisentia.stage.2=§lDiffusion Core§r<BR>The relatively high volatility and immense energy in distilled essentia requires that it first be diffused then digitized. A buffer chamber of some kind will likely be required to hold the diffused essentia.<PAGE><LINE>§lCoalescence Core§r<BR>Compresses and binds re-materialized essentia diffusion back into its raw form. A buffer chamber will also likely be needed.

# Research Digisentia Storage
# 1k
research.essentiastorage1k.title=Digisentia Storage
research.essentiastorage1k.stage.1=Upon inspecting existing digital storage mediums I have concluded that I can in-fact store digitized essentia.<BR>By infusing §lCertus Quartz§r with §lSalis Mundus§r, it should gain the ability to store the essentia, which remains remarkably active even in digital form.<BR>I theorize that the higher the concentration of §lSalis Mundus§r, the more it should be able to store, although there are inherit limits as to how much the quartz itself can store.
research.essentiastorage1k.stage.2=I have managed to create a storage device capable of storing a small amount of essentia digitally, maybe I could combine multiple components for increased storage?
# 4k
research.essentiastorage4k.title=Bigger Digisentia Storage
research.essentiastorage4k.stage.1=Maybe I can use some different processing components to combine multiple storage components together
research.essentiastorage4k.stage.2=I can now store a decent amount of essentia digitally by using some calculation processors to allow the components to talk to each other
# 16k
research.essentiastorage16k.title=Larger Digisentia Storage
research.essentiastorage16k.stage.1=Like I did with my previous attempt to get bigger storage components I can use some high end processors to combine multiple storage components together
research.essentiastorage16k.stage.2=Using another type of processor, I can now store 16x the amount of essentia on a storage component than when I started with my crude storage system
# 64k
research.essentiastorage64k.title=Massive Digisentia Storage
research.essentiastorage64k.stage.1=My current storage needs are not enough, I hope I can still combine storage components to create a larger one while taking up the same space...
research.essentiastorage64k.stage.2=I can now store massive amounts of essentia on a storage component, but I feel that this is the limit of the technology

# Research Essentia Buses
research.essentiabuses.title=Digisentia Transportation
research.essentiabuses.stage.1=Now that I have the components to safely transport essentia with my ME system, I can now work on creating buses for essentia.
research.essentiabuses.stage.2=I can now make Import, Export, and Storage Buses. They all function exactly like their item counterparts.

# Research Essentia Terminal
research.essentiaterminal.title=Essentia Monitoring
research.essentiaterminal.stage.1=While I can now digitize essentia, I have realized this means I can no longer observe the quantities of essentia I have digitalized - an urgent problem.
research.essentiaterminal.stage.2=The ME Essentia Terminal allows me to see all essentia my ME network can access. Additionally, I can insert and extract essentia with phials through it.

# Research Infusion Provider
research.infusionprovider.title=Infusion Provider
research.infusionprovider.stage.1=While being able to manipulate essentia with my ME system has proven invaluable, I am frustrated with the process required for Infusion - I have to extract all my essentia into jars on-site. Perhaps if I could expose my essentia to the Runic Matrix similar to the Essentia Terminal...
research.infusionprovider.stage.2=Success! The Essentia Infusion Provider will expose the entire ME network's essentia to the Infusion process! As a bonus, it also works with my ME Essentia Storage Buses, allowing me to create essentia subnetworks, should I ever need those.

# Research Arcane Crafting Terminal
research.arcaneterminal.title=Arcane Crafting Terminal
research.arcaneterminal.stage.1=Having to hop back and forth between my ME system and my Arcane Workbench for every craft is getting frustrating. While it is vastly more complex than a mere Crafting Terminal, using the same principles, I should be able to hook my Arcane Workbench into my ME system.
research.arcaneterminal.stage.2=The Arcane Crafting Terminal allows my Arcane Workbench to take full advantage of my ME system.
research.arcaneterminal.addenda.1=I can upgrade my Arcane Crafting Terminal with the Arcane Charging Upgrade to allow it to access and draw vis from all neighboring chunks.

# Research Arcane Assembler
research.arcaneassembler.title=Arcane Assembler
research.arcaneassembler.stage.1=While being able to manually craft arcane items with my ME network is very helpful, the true power of ME is its auto-crafting ability. I should look into some way to make a Molecular Assembler able to craft arcane objects.
research.arcaneassembler.stage.2=Everything ought to work - it can get the items, the vis, the Essentia crystals, the power. Yet it doesn't even attempt to craft! I have invented nothing more than a, albeit quite heavy, paperweight. A paperweight which can be augmented with multiple Acceleration Cards. This has been a massive disappointment.
research.arcaneassembler.addenda.1=I can upgrade my Arcane Assembler with the Arcane Charging Upgrade to allow it to access and draw vis from all neighbouring chunks.
research.arcaneassembler.addenda.2=Now that I have seen the Arcane Assembler in use, I have realised a pair of problems - the first being that Vis is consumed at an alarming rate while auto-crafting, often slowing down the process massively, and the second being that Vis Crystals are not shown in the recipe cost. I will need to figure out ways to avoid both of these problems to efficiently auto-craft.

# Research Knowledge Core
research.knowledgecore.title=Knowledge Core
research.knowledgecore.stage.1=I've been thinking about my current paperweight, the Arcane Assembler. Perhaps the issue is that it doesn't know how to craft - it hasn't spent hours researching, after all. I should look into ways to allow the Arcane Assembler to research.
research.knowledgecore.stage.2=Eureka! I don't need to have the Arcane Assembler research - likely an impossible task - I merely need to create something that can remember a craft I've done, and do it exactly the same way. A zombie brain is perfect for this - all I have to do is teach the brain to do exactly the recipe I show it.

# Research Arcane Inscriber
research.arcaneinscriber.title=Arcane Inscriber
research.arcaneinscriber.stage.1=It appears the undead are not very bright. I've been trying to teach this Knowledge Core how to craft for a while now, yet it hasn't learned anything. I need to find a way to force the Knowledge Core to learn.
research.arcaneinscriber.stage.2=Basing my design off of an ME Pattern Terminal, I have managed to design a kind of terminal that can teach recipes to a Knowledge Core. I simply load the recipe into the grid and then save it! I can also examine what recipes I have saved to a Knowledge Core, and if so desired, erase recipes from the zombie's memory. While a single zombie brain is limited in how many recipes it can remember, zombies are plentiful.
