tc.research_name.ADVTHAUMSWORD=Advanced Thaumium Sword
tc.research_text.ADVTHAUMSWORD=Iron blocks weren't versatile enough
advancedswords.research.ADVTHAUMSWORD=Upgrading mundane swords has worked well for you, so your mind turns to magical swords. Surely enough, you've discovered how to upgrade them as well, with the advanced thaumium sword being the first of your discoveries.


tc.research_name.ADVELEMSWORD=Blade of the Cyclone
tc.research_text.ADVELEMSWORD=I just wanna fly
advancedswords.research.ADVELEMSWORD=The Sword of the Zephyr is all well and good, but what if you were to further infuse it to enhance its strength and special properties? The Blade of the Cyclone will, upon blocking, fling you violently upwards into the air instead of simply making you gently float around. However, it will not prevent an extremely unpleasant death by fall damage.


tc.research_name.ADVVOIDSWORD=Advanced Void Sword
tc.research_text.ADVVOIDSWORD=Unlocking the latent vacuum
advancedswords.research.ADVVOIDSWORD=Upgrading the void sword was one of your first goals - it would be immensely powerful and repair itself automatically, after all. As it turns out, this fiendish weapon also has even higher sapping properties than its little brother.


tc.research_name.ADVCRIMSONSWORD=Awakened Crimson Blade
tc.research_text.ADVCRIMSONSWORD=Weakening your foes ablaze
advancedswords.research.ADVCRIMSONSWORD=Ah, the coveted crimson blade. Your research into the Crimson Cult has revealed a nightmarish upgrade that even the cultists dare not apply to their weapons. This blade offers the most comprehensive sapping ability of all the magical swords, and will set all enemies within a 16 block radius on fire when blocking.


tc.research_name.ADVPRIMALSWORD=Primal Annihilator
tc.research_text.ADVPRIMALSWORD=Giving everything up for pure power
advancedswords.research.ADVPRIMALSWORD=The existence of the primal crusher proved that the primordial pearl had immense offensive potential. You decided that it could be improved, though at the cost of its multitool capabilities. This mighty sword sacrifices all of its special abilities in pursuit of pure destruction, and will wither your enemies away.
