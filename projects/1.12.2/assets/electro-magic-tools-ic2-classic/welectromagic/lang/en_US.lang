research.example.text.stage.1=Text not Found

wemt.research.WEMT.stage.1=Who says magic and technology can't go together?
wemt.research.WEMT.stage.2=Who says magic can't work with technology? Our researchers have collaborated with the top mages of the school of Thaumaturgy to bring you the effectiveness of magic coupled with the convenience of electric tools.

wemt.research.electricGoggles.stage.1=The best of both worlds
wemt.research.electricGoggles.stage.2=You have found a way to detect auras using purely electronic means, no longer requiring mystical energy that can be depleted over time. You can now create a pair of Goggles of Revealing that can be recharged with EU while being able to see Aura Nodes just as you could before. A diamond helmet is required to house the sensitive vis sensing circuitry and prevent it from being damaged, which also has the added benefit of providing extra protection.

wemt.research.nanoGoggles.stage.1=Top-tier eye protection
wemt.research.nanoGoggles.stage.2=You have discovered a way to incorporate your previous vis sensors to a Nanosuit Helmet without moving too much around. By infusing the nano helmet with magic, you will be able to use it to see Aura Nodes. During the magical process, the control circuits for the night vision feature are replaced with capacitors to absorb the excess magical energy and vis-sensing microchips.

wemt.research.quantumGoggles.stage.1=Protection coupled with utility
wemt.research.quantumGoggles.stage.2=It took a lot of trial and error, but you have found a way to slip in vis detection sensors to a Quantum Helmet. By infusing the quantum helmet with magic, you will be able to use it to see Aura Nodes. During the design process, you had to replace several control circuits that involve night vision and automatic feeding with vis detecting circuitry and capacitors to absorb the excess magical energy. You find that using a Mining Laser to contain it can safely focus and direct the explosive pulse where the vision effect and the feeding unit of the helmet lie. Have fun getting force-fed energy.

wemt.research.electricScribingTools.stage.1= Save squiddy!
wemt.research.electricScribingTools.stage.2=You have decided not to kill any more squid. Therefore, you researched a way to charge your scribing tools, in a way which would make them not needing any ink. Thanks to static electricity, and the ball pen technology, you managed to make the ink inside the scribing tools spin so quickly, that EU could recharge it.

wemt.research.electricBoots.stage.1=I've got the power
wemt.research.electricBoots.stage.2=With lots of precise mechanical components and a touch of magic, you have recreated the effects of the Boots of the Traveller in a more stable form. These boots, unlike the original, will not wear away over time, but instead use EU. These boots negate all fall damage, and have all the normal properties of the Boots of the Traveller.

wemt.research.nanoBoots.stage.1=Speed demon
wemt.research.nanoBoots.stage.2=Your Electric Boots of the Traveller are nice, but you think you can do better. You have found a way to upgrade these boots to the Nano tier, improving the mechanical components and improving the spell cast on the footwear. These boots allow for higher jumps and faster running than before.

wemt.research.quantumBoots.stage.1=Faster than light
wemt.research.quantumBoots.stage.2=You have meddled with Quantum Physics, making these Quantum Boots of the Traveller so fast, that you appear to be in multiple places at once. But do not forget what happened to Schrodinger's cat...

wemt.research.electricHoe.stage.1=Shockingly natural
wemt.research.electricHoe.stage.2=You have managed to upgrade your Hoe of Growth. It now delivers little shocks to the land and plants around it, much like your regular Hoe of Growth would do. <BR><BR>However, the magic contained within this tool is too powerful for you to convert it fully to using mundane electricity, for the tool still has a limited number of uses before it breaks, but is rechargeable.

wemt.research.diamondChainsaw.stage.1=Harder, better, faster, stronger
wemt.research.diamondChainsaw.stage.2=You are unsure why the thought of upgrading a Chainsaw with diamonds similarly to what you have done with a Drill has never occurred to you. This upgrade makes the Chainsaw capable of holding more energy and breaking blocks faster.

wemt.research.itemThaumiumChainsaw.stage.1=Felling trees and severing heads with a touch of magic
wemt.research.itemThaumiumChainsaw.stage.2=You have found a way to fuse Thaumium to a Diamond Chainsaw, allowing it to fell trees quicker and hold more power. Nevertheless, these ameliorations do not come without drawbacks: during the process of fusing these materials, the chainsaw loses its ability to shear foliage, tall grass, and animals.<BR><BR>You have an intuition you will be able to upgrade this tool in the near future.

wemt.research.itemStreamChainsaw.stage.1=Felling trees in a single swoop
wemt.research.itemStreamChainsaw.stage.2=After studying both the Axe of the Stream and the Thaumium Chainsaw, you managed to combine most of their abilities, resulting in an electric tool that can chop down whole trees without much effort.

wemt.research.itemCluster.name=Macerating Native Ore Clusters
wemt.research.itemCluster.stage.1=Augmenting your yield
wemt.research.itemCluster.stage.2=You can macerate all Native Ore Clusters, except cinnabar. You will get 22 tiny dusts per Native Ore Cluster macerated.

wemt.research.itemOneRing.stage.1=Forged inside the pit of the volcanic Mount Doom...
wemt.research.itemOneRing.stage.2=Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die, One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne in the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them in the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. -J.R.R. Tolkien's epigraph to The Lord of The Rings.<BR>You dream of being able to disappear from sight , therefore becoming invulnerable to any attack. You have heard that this Ring lays somewhere in ruins, unaltered by time...

wemt.research.itemThaumiumDrill.stage.1=Magical mining
wemt.research.itemThaumiumDrill.stage.2=You have discovered a way to infuse Thaumium with mundane electricity. Fusing Thaumium to a Diamond Drill results in a tool that can dig through stone faster and has a higher capacity.<BR><BR>While Thaumium is a very useful and powerful material, it is nowhere near the strength of Iridium. It is considered a mid-tier tool. <BR><BR>This tool may not be the most powerful, but you have a feeling that you will be able to upgrade it in the near future.

wemt.research.itemOmniTool.stage.1=Changing tools is for peasants
wemt.research.itemOmniTool.stage.2=While tinkering with the inner workings of some of your tools to see if magical integration is a possibility, you have discovered a way to combine the Mining Drill and the Chainsaw, resulting in a tool capable of both mining, cutting down trees and attacking enemies! As you are working with mundane metals, magic influence is not needed to merge these tools together.

wemt.research.itemDiamondOmniTool.stage.1=Jack of all trades
wemt.research.itemDiamondOmniTool.stage.2=Your discovery of an Iron Omnitool has driven you to try to accomplish the same with some more powerful devices. You have discovered a way to combine the Diamond Drill and the Diamond Chainsaw, resulting in a tool capable of both mining, cutting down trees and attacking enemies, while maintaining the speed and capacity bonuses of the diamond tools. As diamonds are incredibly tough and nearly impossible to reshape once the raw diamonds have been fashioned into tools such as drills and chainsaws, you will require a little bit of magic to coax them to merge.

wemt.research.itemThaumicOmniTool.stage.1=Mystical multitool
wemt.research.itemThaumicOmniTool.stage.2=After creating the Diamond and Iron Omnitools, the next logical step was to do the same with Thaumium. Unfortunately, this isn't as easy. You have discovered a way to combine the Thaumium Drill and the Thaumium Chainsaw, resulting in a tool capable of mining and chopping trees at great speed with a high energy capacity. These tools have already once been infused with magic. You are not sure what will happen if they were to be infused again.

wemt.research.itemInventoryRing.stage.1=Passive charger
wemt.research.itemInventoryRing.stage.2=While other thaumaturgists use rings to charge their runic shields, you feel that there are better applications for them.  By fusing power sources into a mundane ring, you have learned how to funnel its charging effects into electric items in your inventory instead. It doesn't generate much at only 32 EU per tick, but that just means there's room for improvement.

wemt.research.itemArmourRing.stage.1=Passive life-saver
wemt.research.itemArmourRing.stage.2=You have found the low but constant recharge rate of your new ring to be more useful than anticipated, but it would be nice if it charged your armor when there wasn't a tool in need of power.  By infusing a few more power sources and a piece of armor, you have found a way to have it do just that.  Sadly, the new power sources do not increase the recharge rate, but progress is progress.

wemt.research.itemLightningSummoner.stage.1=From vilest enemies
wemt.research.itemLightningSummoner.stage.2=This item is dropped by your archenemy, the Supercharged Creeper. You feel it is going to be very useful later on.
