thaumicbrewing.research.base.title=Thaumic Brewing
thaumicbrewing.research.base.text.stage.1=Brewing is an interesting art.  It doesn't appear to utilize thaumaturgy, but the results it produces are undeniably special.  I suspect that, with some effort, I could recreate its effects more efficiently using alchemical principles.

thaumicbrewing.research.basic_potions.title=Basic Potions
thaumicbrewing.research.basic_potions.text.stage.1=By studying some of the more basic products of brewing, I should be able to learn how to recreate them using essentia.
thaumicbrewing.research.basic_potions.text.stage.2=Success!  I've devised several recipes for creating potions with alchemy, using Alkimia essentia as a binder.  Now to see how I can expand on that.

thaumicbrewing.research.advanced_potions.title=Advanced Potions
thaumicbrewing.research.advanced_potions.text.stage.1=I've been unable so far to recreate some of the more complex brewing recipes using a water base.  Perhaps augmenting existing potions will get me the results I'm after... 
thaumicbrewing.research.advanced_potions.text.stage.2=My theory was correct.  By using an existing potion as a catalyst, I'm now able to create more complex types of potions.

thaumicbrewing.research.harmful_potions.title=Debilitating Potions
thaumicbrewing.research.harmful_potions.text.stage.1=Like thaumaturgy, brewing has a dark side.  Is it worth recreating that as well?
thaumicbrewing.research.harmful_potions.text.stage.2=As I suspected, a simple inversion of effect using Perditio essentia was enough to turn helpful potions into debilitating ones.  Not that I'd recommend actually drinking any of them.

thaumicbrewing.research.strong_basic_potions.title=Powerful Basic Potions
thaumicbrewing.research.strong_basic_potions.text.stage.1=Brewing allows for several types of potions to be given an enhanced effect with the addition of redstone dust.  Perhaps that amplification process can be reproduced alchemically as well.
thaumicbrewing.research.strong_basic_potions.text.stage.2=A splash of Potentia did the trick.  That shouldn't surprise me, given how chock full of the stuff redstone is, but I confess that I'd expected it to be a bit more... complicated.

thaumicbrewing.research.strong_advanced_potions.title=Powerful Advanced Potions
thaumicbrewing.research.strong_advanced_potions.text.stage.1=I wonder if advanced potions can have their effects amplified in the same way that basic potions can.  This warrants further experimentation.
thaumicbrewing.research.strong_advanced_potions.text.stage.2=Just like basic potions, a touch of Potentia was enough to make my advanced potions more powerful.

thaumicbrewing.research.strong_harmful_potions.title=Powerful Debilitating Potions
thaumicbrewing.research.strong_harmful_potions.text.stage.1=Can my debilitating potions be made more powerful?  Is it worth the cost?
thaumicbrewing.research.strong_harmful_potions.text.stage.2=For better or worse, these foul concoctions are even more potent than before.

thaumicbrewing.research.long_basic_potions.title=Extended Basic Potions
thaumicbrewing.research.long_basic_potions.text.stage.1=Several types of brewed potions can have the duration of their effects extended by adding some glowstone dust to the mix.  How do I recreate that with alchemy?
thaumicbrewing.research.long_basic_potions.text.stage.2=Strangely enough, Lux essentia was the answer.  I wouldn't have expected it to have time-related effects, but then again it is found in the glowstone that brewing uses.  Perhaps there's some unseen connection between the two arts.

thaumicbrewing.research.long_advanced_potions.title=Extended Advanced Potions
thaumicbrewing.research.long_advanced_potions.text.stage.1=It stands to reason that if basic potions can have their effects extended, then advanced potions should as well.  Only one way to find out.
thaumicbrewing.research.long_advanced_potions.text.stage.2=As with my earlier experiments, a little bit of Lux has extended the effects of my advanced potions.

thaumicbrewing.research.long_harmful_potions.title=Extended Debilitating Potions
thaumicbrewing.research.long_harmful_potions.text.stage.1=Perhaps these debilitating potions can have their effects extended as well.  Assuming, of course, that I'm willing to partake in that kind of research.
thaumicbrewing.research.long_harmful_potions.text.stage.2=Light is a strange thing to be adding to such dark mixtures, but alchemy doesn't always conform to our expectations.  Nonetheless, it accomplished my goals here.

thaumicbrewing.research.splash_potions.title=Splash Potions
thaumicbrewing.research.splash_potions.text.stage.1=Sometimes I don't want to drink a potion myself, but rather apply its effects to another.  At a brewing stand I'd add a pinch of gunpowder to cause the flask to burst.  How can I recreate that effect using essentia?
thaumicbrewing.research.splash_potions.text.stage.2=The gunpowder angle was a red herring, but I've found my answer.  By adding some Aqua essentia to the any potion, I can cause it to splash readily upon contact with a surface.

thaumicbrewing.research.lingering_potions.title=Lingering Potions
thaumicbrewing.research.lingering_potions.text.stage.1=Some rare brews can have their effects linger in a cloud upon exposure to the air, but the main ingredient for that, dragon's breath, isn't the easiest thing to come by.  I'm going to need another solution if I want to replicate this.
thaumicbrewing.research.lingering_potions.text.stage.2=A little outside-the-box thinking has brought to me the answer: Spiritus!  Just as the spirits of the lost linger, so too shall any potions that I infuse with it.
