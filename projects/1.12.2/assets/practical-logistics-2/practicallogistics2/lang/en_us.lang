guide.Welcome.title=Welcome to Practical Logistics 2!
guide.Welcome.name=Practical Logistics 2 gives you the ability to create automated systems for reading, displaying and acting upon data. You can monitor items, energy, fluids, entities, machines, tanks, light, weather, direction, movement and much more.- -You can create Item, Fluid and Energy networks and transfer them anywhere in the world instantly; you can even transfer across dimensions. This mod also gives you more interactive control, via the use of Large Display Screens.- -This gives you infinite control and management of your base. You can also monitor and control blocks wirelessly.- -This mod is a continuation of the mod Practical Logistics 1.7.10.-This mod was created by Ollie Lansdell.
guide.GettingStarted.title=Getting started
guide.GettingStarted.name=To get started with Practical Logisitics you need to find some #SapphireOre# in the overworld. Once you have found a plentiful supply build yourself a #Hammer# and make sure you have some #StonePlate#, #Sapphire# and #SapphireDust#. Next build some #DataCable# and you're ready to start with Practical Logisitcs.- -<blue>Basic Principals<reset>-To get started you first need to connect the blocks or entities you want to monitor/interact with. These blocks will be referred to as the Connections or the Channels-See #Node#, #EntityNode#, #Array#, #Transceiver#, #EntityTransceiver# on how to connect channels-To read info from the channels you need to use a Reader, there are currently four types which can show various types of data.-See #InfoReader#, #InventoryReader#, #FluidReader#, #EnergyReader#.
guide.GettingStarted2.name=Once you've setup a reader and a channel you can display the data using a screen. This must be connected to the outward side of the reader-See #DisplayScreen#, #LargeDisplayScreen#, #HolographicDisplay#.- -To then act upon this data you can use the #RedstoneSignaller#.- -These are all the principal blocks required for most basic setups which you can see examples for on #2#.

//item guide pages
guide.SapphireOre.name=Sapphire Ore spawns in the overworld and is relatively common. It is used for obtaining #Sapphire#. It spawns between Y Level && and &&- -It requires an Iron Pickaxe to mine.

The #CURRENT# has various modes for selecting inventory data...- -<blue>Inventories:<reset> This will display the list of items as sorted by the Inventory Reader.-<blue>Stack:<reset> This will display how many items are stored of the selected type. Select an item by clicking with it onto the slot next to the mode button.-<blue>Slot:<reset> This mode will display the item in the selected slot of the first connected inventory. To select a slot type it into the input box next to the mode button. You can configure the first connected inventory by entering the 'Channels' Menu.-<blue>Pos:<reset> This mode will display the item in the selected position of the item list as sorted by the Inventory Reader.-<blue>Storage:<reset> This will create a progress bar of Items Stored against total possible items stored similar to those created by the #InfoReader#. 
guide.InventoryReader2.name=<blue>Filters:<reset> Similar to 'Inventories' mode except you can filter the items shown in a similar way to the #TransferNode#

guide.SapphireDust.name=Obtained by placing #Sapphire# in the #Hammer#- -It shares the qualities of #Sapphire# and is a key crafting ingredient in the mod.
guide.StonePlate.name=#CURRENT# is a rigid and durable item making it ideal for creating Logistics Blocks and is therefore a key crafting ingredient in the mod
guide.Transceiver.name=The Transceiver is used to wirelessly connect blocks to the network preventing the need for a #Node#.-To do this you must first shift_right click the block you wish to connect. Once the Transceiver has been connected place it inside a #Array# on the network you wish to connect it to.- -#CURRENT#s have an infinite range and can be placed in any dimension you wish.
guide.EntityTransceiver.name=The Entity Transceiver operates in exactly the same way as the #Transceiver# except it works for Entities rather than blocks.- -To connect a normal Entity just right click it. Or you can link yourself to the #CURRENT# by shift right clicking.- -#CURRENT#s have an infinite range and can be placed in any dimension you wish.

Connecting a display to the side will display the current time of the clock as a progress bar. You can also see the progress of the clock by the rotating hand at the top. When it passes the small red marker it will emit a signal.- -Inside the GUI you can set the interval, this can be anywhere between 0.100 ms to 24 hours, however if the clock isn't chunk loaded the timer will be reset.
