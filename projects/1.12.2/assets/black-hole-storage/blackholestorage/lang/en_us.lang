##MANUAL##
hc.manual_name.bh.intro=Intro
hc.manual_text.bh.intro=Introduction to Black Hole Storage
bhs.manual_desc.intro=Black Hole Storage is a mod about mysterious places in our universe. It allows player to manually create and maintain own little Black Hole. If it would be natural, it would cause far more damage than hand-made. Note: this mod is end-game, because it requires billions of RF to use, so you might want to take a look at Solar Flux Reborn. To get started with the mod, make Atomic Transformer.

hc.manual_name.bh.atomic_transformer=Atomic Transformer
hc.manual_text.bh.atomic_transformer=Reconstructing atomically!
bhs.manual_desc.atomic_transformer=Atomic Transformer is your first step towards compressing space in a tiny size. Using this machine you can transform some items into others using RF.

hc.manual_name.bh.anti_matter=Anti Matter
hc.manual_text.bh.anti_matter=How does it not explode?
bhs.manual_desc.anti_matter=Anti Matter is really expensive. Basically you need 8 billion RF to create one atom of this dangerous material. Anti Matter is capable of destructing Black Hole or close link between two points in space. Note that in order to destroy Black Hole you need it to be unstable and throw Anti Matter into it. The results are explosive. Actually, no, it's more than explosive!

hc.manual_name.bh.black_hole=Black Hole
hc.manual_text.bh.black_hole=Item goes in, and, well, doesn't return back!
bhs.manual_desc.black_hole.1=Hand made black hole isn't as dangerous, but it still owns a big mass and keeping it under a shield is a very smart thing to do. Black Holes have a 1 million shield capacity and depending on the mass of black hole the shield will get damaged more, thus needing more power. To charge it's shield you need black hole chargers.

hc.manual_name.bh.black_hole_former=Black Hole Former
hc.manual_text.bh.black_hole_former=Make the world end
bhs.manual_desc.black_hole_former=Black Hole Former is used to form a black hole. It requires 32,000,000,000 RF to make a black hole. Note: Black Hole Former will get destroyed and Black Hole will form on top of Black Hole Former (y + 1). See the actual former recipe on next page...

hc.manual_name.bh.black_hole_charger=Black Hole Charger
hc.manual_text.bh.black_hole_charger=Preventing dangerous accidents
bhs.manual_desc.black_hole_charger=Black Hole Charger is required to charge Black Hole's shield. You can place up to 4 of this blocks. Each charger consumes up to 1000 RF/tick to recover black hole's shield. It can be placed up to 32 blocks away from Black Hole. The red tip of the charger must point on a black hole, as said with a maximal of 32 blocks away.

hc.manual_name.bh.rf_injector=RF Injector
hc.manual_text.bh.rf_injector=Storing RF
bhs.manual_desc.rf_injector=RF Injector allows you to actually store the energy inside of a Black Hole. Note: if you had fluids or other type of storage in the black hole, you must clear it using that type's ejector. You can see how to place it on the next page.

hc.manual_name.bh.rf_ejector=RF Ejector
hc.manual_text.bh.rf_ejector=Taking RF Back
bhs.manual_desc.rf_ejector=RF Ejector allows you to actually use the energy from a Black Hole. Note: if you had fluids or other type of storage in the black hole, ejector won't do anything. You can see how to place it on the next page.

hc.manual_name.bh.fluid_injector=Fluid Injector
hc.manual_text.bh.fluid_injector=Storing Fluids
bhs.manual_desc.fluid_injector=Fluid Injector allows you to actually store the fluids inside of a Black Hole. Note: if you had other types of fluids fluids, energy or other type of storage in the black hole, you must clear it using that type's ejector (fluid ejector for other fluids). You can see how to place it on the next page.

hc.manual_name.bh.fluid_ejector=Fluid Ejector
hc.manual_text.bh.fluid_ejector=Taking Fluids Back
bhs.manual_desc.fluid_ejector=Fluid Ejector allows you to actually use the fluids from a Black Hole. Note: if you had other fluids, energy or other type of storage in the black hole, ejector won't do anything. You can see how to place it on the next page.
