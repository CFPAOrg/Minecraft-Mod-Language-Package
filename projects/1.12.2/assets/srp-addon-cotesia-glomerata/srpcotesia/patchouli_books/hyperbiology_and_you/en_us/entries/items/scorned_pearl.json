The Scorned Pearl can be used to substantially increase their effectiveness, guaranteeing the Hive will be set back by several Phases if used properly by frying Source linkages in a large radius."

Holding it in the offhand while using a Carcass will consume the item, reducing the Evolution Phase and severely damaging parasites in a 10 chunk radius.$(br)Parasites within 5 chunks of the blast will have their ability to adapt to damage sources completely disabled, and within half that distance they will be stunned as well."
