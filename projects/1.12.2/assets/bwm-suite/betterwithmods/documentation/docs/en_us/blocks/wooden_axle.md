![Wooden Axle](block:betterwithmods:wooden_axle)

The Wooden Axle is used to transfer continuous mechanical power in conjunction with [Gearbox](wooden_gearbox.md).

These wood and rope devices are only able to handle 3 blocks in a row before breaking under the stress.
This is where Gearboxes come into play, allowing junctioning and repeating the signal from the Axle.

Axles are also where [Windmills] and [Waterwheels] are placed to begin creating Mechanical Power
