![Anchor](block:betterwithmods:anchor)

The Anchor is used for holding rope in place. 
If placed on the sides or bottom of block, the rope can be continually clicked with [Rope](../items/rope.md) to extend a climbable rope as far as possible. It can be shift-clicked with an empty hand to remove rope from the bottom.

If placed on the top of a [Platform](platform.md) or [Iron Wall](iron_wall.md) the anchor can connect the rope of a [Pulley](pulley.md) allowing all connected platforms to be moved.
