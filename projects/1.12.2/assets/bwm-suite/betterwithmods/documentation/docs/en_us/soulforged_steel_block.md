![Soulforged Steel Block](block:betterwithmods:steel_block)

The Soulforged Steel Block, created from 16 [Soulforged Steel Ingots](../items/soulforged_steel.md) in an [Anvil](anvil.md), is a very strong block that cannot be pushed by Pistons and cannot be destroyed by the Wither. It requires a [Refined Pickaxe or Mattack](../items/refined_tools.md) to be broken.
Due to the massive amount of souls used to create this block when it is combined with a [Beacon](../hardcore/beacons.md) it has the ability to bind the Player's soul to its location.
