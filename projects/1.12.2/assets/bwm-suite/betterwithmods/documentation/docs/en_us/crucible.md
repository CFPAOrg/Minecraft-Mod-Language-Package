![Crucible](block:betterwithmods:cooking_pot)

The Crucible is a very, very important crafting pot, created from smelting an unfired crucible in a Kiln. This pot enables the creation of Soulforged Steel and the smelting of manufactured tools and armor down into their components, enabling recycling from say... Mob traps. Or nearly-broken armor/tools you've been using for a while now.

The Crucible is also unique in that the majority of it's functionality is locked behind having a steady stoked flame. As you will have made the Crucible with a stoked flame in the Kiln, you will likely know how to maintain a stoked flame from that experience, so this will not be repeated here.

Like it's iron brother, the [Cauldron](block:betterwithmods:cooking_pot@1), the Crucible benefits from having more fire underneth it in a 3x3 area. The details on that are talked about on it's page, but will be repeated here for clarity and having to save you from clicking more:
* Needs a fire directly under it.
* Each additional fire in the 3x3 ring surrounding the fire underneth the Crucible.
* If you're using stoked fire, then make sure the fire sources come from Hibachis, or else the fire will get blown out.

Stoked Crucible uses:
* Creation of Soulforged Steel, utilizing a Soul Urn, Coal/Charcoal Dust, an Iron Ingot, and Soul Flux.
* 100% return ratio for recycling Diamond/Soulforged Steel tools, armors, and weapons
* 66% return ratio for every other metal's tools, armors, and weapons (This 66% is the default, and may have been changed by the modpack author, if this mod was included in a modpack.)
* Mass smelting of cobblestone and sand into stone and glass, respectively. This saves you on fuel costs in the furnace MASSIVELY.
* Recycling tons of other metal stuff, also at a 66% return ratio, but with a mostly lossless conversion rate for some stuff.
* Compressing nuggets into ingots, mainly for use with the above reycling factors, and also mob farms. Supports most modded ingots if they have a nugget form they break down into.
* Other mods, such as Better With Addons, may add additional recipes and uses for the stoked crucible!
