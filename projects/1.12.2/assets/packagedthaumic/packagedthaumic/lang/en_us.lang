tc.research_category.PACKAGEDTHAUMIC=Packaging

research.packagedthaumic.PACKAGING.title=Packaging
research.packagedthaumic.PACKAGING.stage.1=I have studied the machines of packaging.<BR>I believe it should be possible to use packaging with thaumic recipes, as it is possible to encode thaumic recipes in the Package Recipe Encoder.<BR>Therefore, I shall dedicate a section focusing on accomplishing this.  

research.packagedthaumic.THAUMICPACKAGECOMPONENT.title=Thaumic Packaging Component
research.packagedthaumic.THAUMICPACKAGECOMPONENT.stage.1=Thaumic recipes are different from most other recipes, as simple instructions for thaumic recipes aren't sufficient for one to craft them; they require thaumic knowledge. Thus, the ordinary packaging component would not be sufficient for thaumic recipes.<BR>Perhaps I should study the packaging component along with some thaumic components to see if there is a way to resolve this.
research.packagedthaumic.THAUMICPACKAGECOMPONENT.stage.2=Combining a packaging component with a clockwork mind and some amber should allow the packaging component to somewhat "remember" my thaumic knowledge, allowing them to craft thaumic recipes.
research.packagedthaumic.THAUMICPACKAGECOMPONENT.addendum.ae=I have used an ME packaging component here since I want to access an ME system in thaumic packaging machines like with other packaging machines.

research.packagedthaumic.REINFORCEDPOROUSSTONE.title=Taint Residue Studies
research.packagedthaumic.REINFORCEDPOROUSSTONE.stage.1=In the absence of a "seed" as a core, tainted growth decays.<BR>I should wait for taint to spread, collect some tainted growth using silk touch, and study the results of their decay.
research.packagedthaumic.REINFORCEDPOROUSSTONE.stage.2=Tainted organic materials decay into a goo of Taint, and tainted soil decay into dirt.<BR>Tainted rock decay, however, is interesting. Instead of decaying into cobblestone or gravel, tainted rock decays into a porous stone.<BR>I should obtain another sample of this porous stone by letting tainted rock decay naturally and study its properties, as it may be of use.
research.packagedthaumic.REINFORCEDPOROUSSTONE.stage.3=It seems like the porousness of the stone is caused by the Taint condensing into various types of crystals.<BR>This should make it a great material for insulating essentia.<BR>This porous stone is too fragile for use right now, but I should be able to reinforce it.
research.packagedthaumic.REINFORCEDPOROUSSTONE.stage.4=By adding some essentia to the porous stone, I have successfully reinforced it for use.<BR>The porous stone also seems to be adsorbing small amounts of both vis and flux from the aura.

research.packagedthaumic.POROUSSTONEPLATE.title=Porous Stone Plate
research.packagedthaumic.POROUSSTONEPLATE.stage.1=Simply reinforcing the porous stone is not enough for it to be used in devices and machines.<BR>I should study a piece of the reinforced porous stone to study how I can properly utilize it.
research.packagedthaumic.POROUSSTONEPLATE.stage.2=By adding a layer of pipes to the porous stone, I should be able to let the porous disperse adsorbed essentia in a controlled manner, and allowing it to be used in devices and machines.

research.packagedthaumic.CLATHRATEESSENCEFORMER.title=Essentia Clathrates
research.packagedthaumic.CLATHRATEESSENCEFORMER.stage.1=Packaging requires the components of the packages to all be items, so I'll have to use an item form of essentia.<BR>While packaging has the capacity to make "volume packages" for scenarios like this, it seems like the machines of the current era cannot utilize this.<BR>I could use vis crystals, but the method of producing them requires a source of quartz, and is inefficient.<BR>I may be able to swap out the quartz with ice to create essentia clathrates. I should experiment with this using dense ice and some essentia.
research.packagedthaumic.CLATHRATEESSENCEFORMER.stage.2=I have designed a machine that forms essentia clathrates from essentia water.<BR>Water is supplied by an Everfull Urn, and essentia supplied with pipes is dissolved into the water.<BR>The machine then freezes the water using power and some volume packaging capacities, forming essentia clathrates.<BR>Each essentia clathrate only requires one unit of essentia.
research.packagedthaumic.CLATHRATEESSENCEFORMER.addendum.ae=If the Essentia Clathrate Former is connected to an ME system, it can draw energy from the ME system and automatically put the formed essentia clathrates into the ME system.

research.packagedthaumic.VIRIALCHAMBER.title=Virial Chamber
research.packagedthaumic.VIRIALCHAMBER.stage.1=When studying eldritch knowledge, I've had a glimpse into the past.<BR>In a past era, thaumaturges get vis from nodes of aura. They energize them with beams of energy, creating a steady stream of vis to power their devices and machines.<BR>With this way of using vis, there is no worry of running out of it. Sadly, these aura nodes no longer exist, and they won't return for a long time.<BR>However, I may be able to create somthing similar to energized aura nodes artificially.<BR>It should be possible to use porous stone to create a small region with almost no aura, and letting a small bit of aura through using mirror magic.<BR>This should create a virtual aura node that then could be beamed with energy to create more vis.<BR>I should study this further.
research.packagedthaumic.VIRIALCHAMBER.stage.2=I have succeeded in designing the device containing the "Energized Virtual Aura Node", which I am going to call the "Virial Chamber" since it creates vis.<BR>It can convert normal energy into vis by beaming the energy into the virtual aura node.<BR>However, this created vis isn't compatible with the aura as it somehows contains essentia, causing the created vis to turn almost entirely into flux.<BR>Therefore, I would need to use this vis immediately, which restricts the use of this device of being a component of other devices and machines that would normally use vis from the aura.

research.packagedthaumic.ARCANECRAFTER.title=Packaged Arcane Crafting
research.packagedthaumic.ARCANECRAFTER.stage.1=I should be able to design a basic package crafter that crafts arcane recipes using vis from the aura.<BR>When designing, I should also combine the workbench charger with the crafter for it to use a wider area of aura.
research.packagedthaumic.ARCANECRAFTER.stage.2=I have designed the Arcane Package Crafter.<BR>It can automatically craft arcane recipes I currently know from packages, and draws vis to do so.<BR>If I learn more arcane recipes, I can interact with it to update its knowledge.<BR>However, due to how the machine works, I am not able to give it any vis discount.<BR>Perhaps there is a way to resolve this.
research.packagedthaumic.ARCANECRAFTER.addendum.ae=If the Arcane Package Crafter is connected to an ME system, it can draw energy from the ME system and automatically put crafted items into the ME system.

research.packagedthaumic.VIRIALARCANECRAFTER.title=Virial Packaged Arcane Crafting
research.packagedthaumic.VIRIALARCANECRAFTER.stage.1=By combining the Virial Chamber and the Arcane Package Crafter, I should be able to make a package crafter that generates required vis on its own to craft arcane recipes.
research.packagedthaumic.VIRIALARCANECRAFTER.stage.2=I have designed the Virial Arcane Package Crafter.<BR>The crafter now generates required vis with energy, and the craft time now depends on the vis required.<BR>Due to the nature of the vis generated by the Virial Chamber, some flux will occasionally be leaked from the machine.
research.packagedthaumic.VIRIALARCANECRAFTER.addendum.ae=If the Virial Arcane Package Crafter is connected to an ME system, it can automatically put crafted items into the ME system. It cannot draw energy from the ME system.

research.packagedthaumic.VIRIALRECHARGEPEDESTAL.title=Virial Recharge Pedestal
research.packagedthaumic.VIRIALRECHARGEPEDESTAL.stage.1=By combining the Virial Chamber and the Recharge Pedestal, I should be able to make a vis charging device that uses vis generated with energy.
research.packagedthaumic.VIRIALRECHARGEPEDESTAL.stage.2=I have designed the Virial Recharge Pedestal.<BR>It uses vis generated with energy to charge rechargeable items with vis.<BR>Due to the nature of the vis generated by the Virial Chamber, some flux will occasionally be leaked from the machine.

research.packagedthaumic.CRUCIBLECRAFTER.title=Packaged Alchemy
research.packagedthaumic.CRUCIBLECRAFTER.stage.1=I should be able to design a package crafter that is based on the Thaumatorium that crafts crucible recipes using essentia clathrates.
research.packagedthaumic.CRUCIBLECRAFTER.stage.2=I have designed the Package Thaumatorium.<BR>It is half the size of the Thaumatorium, but it still requires a crucible and a heat source to work.<BR>It can automatically craft crucible recipes I currently know from packages.<BR>If I learn more crucible recipes, I can interact with it to update its knowledge.<BR>The craft time depends on the amount of essentia required, and the total required time is roughly half that of the Thaumatorium.
research.packagedthaumic.CRUCIBLECRAFTER.addendum.ae=If the Package Thaumatorium is connected to an ME system, it can draw energy from the ME system and automatically put crafted items into the ME system.

research.packagedthaumic.INFUSIONCRAFTER.title=Packaged Infusion
research.packagedthaumic.INFUSIONCRAFTER.stage.1=I should now try to design a package crafter that automates the Infusion Altar, crafting infusion recipes using essentia clathrates.<BR>I would want the crafter to be as reliable as possible, and my studies on stabilizers and biothaumic minds should help.
research.packagedthaumic.INFUSIONCRAFTER.stage.2=I have designed the Package Runic Matrix, which can be used to form the Package Infusion Altar.<BR>It can automatically craft infusion recipes I currently know from packages.<BR>If I learn more infusion recipes, I can interact with it to update its knowledge.<BR>Special pedestals that are marked and stabilized are required.<BR>The crafter will not start a craft unless it considers the surroundings to be stable enough.<BR>If at any point the infusion process does become unstable, it will use its internal stabilizer to stop items from being destroyed.<BR>The craft time depends on both the amount of essentia required and the amount of ingredients, and the total required time should be the same as regular infusion. 
research.packagedthaumic.INFUSIONCRAFTER.addendum.boost=Infusion boosting works slightly differently in the Package Infusion Altar.<BR>Speed modifiers modify both essentia and item craft time.<BR>Cost modifiers cannot change the amount of essentia uses, so they modify essentia craft time.
research.packagedthaumic.INFUSIONCRAFTER.addendum.ae=If the Package Runic Matrix is connected to an ME system, it can draw energy from the ME system and automatically put crafted items into the ME system.

research.packagedthaumic.INFUSIONCRAFTERANCIENT.title=Packaged Infusion: Ancient Stone
research.packagedthaumic.INFUSIONCRAFTERANCIENT.stage.1=I can use ancient stone to build components of the Package Infusion Altar, with effects similar to using ancient stone in a normal infusion altar.

research.packagedthaumic.INFUSIONCRAFTERELDRITCH.title=Packaged Infusion: Eldritch Stone
research.packagedthaumic.INFUSIONCRAFTERELDRITCH.stage.1=I can use eldritch stone to build components of the Package Infusion Altar, with effects similar to using eldritch stone in a normal infusion altar.

research.packagedthaumic.CLATHRATEESSENCEMATERIALIZER.title=Digisentia Clathrates
research.packagedthaumic.CLATHRATEESSENCEMATERIALIZER.stage.1=I have been able to create components that are able to transport essentia digitally in ME systems.<BR>Therefore, it may be convenient to be able to directly convert digital essentia to essentia clathrates in an ME system.<BR>To do this, I would need to form essentia clathrates instantaneously.
research.packagedthaumic.CLATHRATEESSENCEMATERIALIZER.stage.2=By combining multiple Essentia Clathrate Formers together with the coalescence core and some fluix, I have created a machine that converts digital essentia into essentia clathrates instantaneously.<BR>I need to make sure my ME system has sufficient energy storage to use this device, as much more energy is needed to achieve instantaneous essentia clathrate formation, and the device can only use energy from the ME system.<BR>I also should not add more than one of this device to my ME system, as doing this will make the ME system count the same essentia multiple times.
