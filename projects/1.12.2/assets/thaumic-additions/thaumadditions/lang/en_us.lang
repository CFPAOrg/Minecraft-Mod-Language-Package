card.thaumadditions:base.name=Thaumic Additions
card.thaumadditions:base.text=You study the unusual objects and events around you. Gain from %,d to %,d §lThaumic Additions§r and 1 bonus draw.

research_name.thaumadditions:thaumadds=Thaumic Additions
research_stage.thaumadditions:thaumadds.1=Through my travels, I've had several unique theories come and go, none of which related to the other topics I've encountered so far. Perhaps the time has come to delve further into the stranger Thaumic encounters I've had...
research_stage.thaumadditions:thaumadds.2=I've finished most of the work of sorting all the originally undocumented findings into this Additions tab in the Thaumonomicon. From here, I should be able to explore new avenues of thought, and perhaps even rediscover knowledge of Thaumaturges' past.

research_name.thaumadditions:essence_salt=Salty Vis
research_stage.thaumadditions:essence_salt.1=Despite all the research I've done regarding them, I've still not done what man always aims to do: made it edible. Considering how fragile they are, it may be possible to grind them into a substance akin to salt? No reason not to try, I guess
research_stage.thaumadditions:essence_salt.2=Well, that was a waste of time. Even though I've studied them forever, it was still shocking how fragile they seem, broken pieces practically evaporating in my hands. I can only assume that the lone shards lost stability to the larger chunks of crystal as I ground it... <BR>Hm... perhaps crushing it all at once, evenly, will keep the shards equally stable? My own weight from an average height should do the trick - though, it may be best to test with multiple at once, considering the chance of it failing.
research_stage.thaumadditions:essence_salt.3=My theory seemed to be correct, in some regards. I've created a semi-stable salt, with a... lets just say, 'unique' taste. Its safe to assume though that most will be edible - and, if their aspects have any relation to their effects, perhaps even beneficial, or dangerous. <LINE>For further reference, the process is both lossy and somewhat painful on my legs: §lI'll need to jump from 15 or more blocks onto the crystals, of which there should be at LEAST two§r, considering the lossy nature of breaking them apart under my feet.<BR>I can combine the resulting salt with foods to apply varying effects, or to itself for the sake of storage/combinations of effects.

research_name.thaumadditions:mithrillium=Mithrillium Metal
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithrillium.1=Yet still, my mind wanders down darker paths, the Void filling it with calls to improve its already terrifying power... Against my better judgement, I've written the dark infusion the whispers requested of me. <BR>As powerful as this seems, I severely doubt this will be good for my sanity.
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithrillium.2=I'm... surprised, actually. The Void's whispers still continue to mention empowering their metal, despite having done just that? Perhaps I've accidentally cured the metal of some of its corruption..? <BR>A strange metal with a blue sheen, it has the strange contradictive properties of the Void Metal, but without its cursed impurities. The only thing that slipped through past the Void's cries for power was a strange sound, similar to Myth. I suppose its as good a name as any: §lMithrillium§r. It should be of some use in improving my technology, with fewer downsides of... the Void.......

research_name.thaumadditions:mithminite=Mithminite Metal
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite.1=My thirst for the perfect material never ends. Despite the powers of Adaminite, with its red hue now coming to remind me of Ichor, God's blood, is truly amazing... but had to trade some of its material strength for magical. Perhaps if I infused more Mithrillium into it, it could regain some of its lost strength... I've drawn up a diagram for this, a much more simple ritual than the last one.
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite.2=Further, further, this material's power grows. The quicksilver worked perfectly, drawing the hardness of the Mithrillium back into the Adaminite. The simple combination of them into §lMithminite§r has created a wonder-material, but... its use is yet to be properly discovered.

research_name.thaumadditions:adaminite=Adaminite Metal
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite.1=I simply just can't learn when to stop. Despite the strange and contradictive powers of Mithrillium, I've been filled with renewed temptations, dreams of even greater power. If I simply infuse the Mithrillium with the most powerful materials I can find...
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite.2=Yet again to my surprise, this damned experiment was in fact successful! Minus a few small fires, of course. <BR>This strong, blood-red material, which I've dubbed §lAdaminite§r simply because it was the first unused word to come to mind, is more magically inclined than its parent metal, and should be of further use despite its expenses.

research_name.thaumadditions:mithrillium_smelter=Mithrillium Smeltery
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithrillium_smelter.1=As I mentioned in the original entry, the potential of Mithrillium to have purer reactions should definitely be looked into. Even with the power of the Void Metal, I occasionally noticed it sapped about 5% of essentia for its own dark purposes...
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithrillium_smelter.2=This is much purer, indeed. In fact, I don't think I've logged any sort of loss - the essentia slurry it creates can't even be regarded as a slurry any more, as if it's been pre-separated by the metal. It's truly the perfect reaction, with near-0% loss.

research_name.thaumadditions:adaminite_smelter=Adaminite Smeltery
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite_smelter.1=I find that the total purity of the Mithrillium Smeltery still isn't enough. Even with no loss, could there instead also be gain? Perhaps using the magic property of Adaminite in the filter would be beneficial...
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite_smelter.2=Amazing. By filtering some of the raw essentia through an Adaminite casing, nearby matching essentia from the aura seemed to pass through and condense inside. This should see a roughly 20% increase to output essentia, which should help me save on rarer materials.

research_name.thaumadditions:mithminite_smelter=Mithminite Smeltery
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_smelter.1=Honestly? I've no clue how I could possibly improve upon the smeltery further, but it's worth a try. New magical metal, new essentia smeltery.
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_smelter.2=This expense doesn't quite feel worth it, honestly. I suppose the new Mithminite smeltery is faster and has a higher extra output (+50%), but the insane cost makes it of questionable use unless I can spare the materials. I suppose if the time comes, it will be here.

research_name.thaumadditions:brass_jar=Brass Warded Jars
research_stage.thaumadditions:brass_jar.1=The old technique of warding jars with essentia is efficient and all, but feels... outdated. This is a new era, and my only solution for storage is a small jar with a wooden cap? Surely I have the materials to improve upon it, at least in the sake of testing...
research_stage.thaumadditions:brass_jar.2=Take that, you old fools! Long gone are the days of wood! By strengthening the glass with some extra vis infusions and replacing the outdated wooden cap with a polished brass lid, I've managed to better secure the jar. It only stores 25 more essentia, bringing the total to 275, but as a proof-of-concept, it definitely shows that I can improve upon the outdated essentia storage.

research_name.thaumadditions:thaumium_jar=Thaumium Reinforced Jars
research_stage.thaumadditions:thaumium_jar.1=Again, my material studies have given me new potential to improve upon my equipment. The magical nature of Thaumium has seen much use in other places, but its yet to be tested how well it stores raw essentia.
research_stage.thaumadditions:thaumium_jar.2=By again reinforcing the warding aura of the jar's glass and fastening a specially-made Thaumium lid, I've observed a nice improvement to the original jars. The magical properties of the metal seem to sponge up some of the essentia, acting as an extra storage chamber in a way. Overall, this should see an increase of roughly one hundred from the original jar, a total of 350 essentia.

research_name.thaumadditions:eldritch_jar=Void Reinforced Jars
research_stage.thaumadditions:eldritch_jar.1=If I were to say that the Void's whispers were the only thing influencing me writing this, I'd be lying. It's become a genuine curiosity to see how different materials react with raw essentia, and despite all the evil surrounding this blackened ingot, I don't see too much harm in a few tests... 
research_stage.thaumadditions:eldritch_jar.2=After a few straining tests to make sure the Void Metal didn't damage the glass seal of the jar, I've managed to finally draft a lid to top the new jar. The initial tests actually came to little surprise: the jet-black metal seems to sponge up the raw essentia in a way akin to Thaumium, except in a greater quantity. Adding it to the new strengthened glass warding, it should store an estimated §n500 essentia§r.<BR>Regardless of my success here though, it's best I keep an eye on this. The Void's desires are beyond me - I feel its stare every time I glance at that blackened lid. Plus, the material cost of these upgrades is getting quite extreme...

research_name.thaumadditions:mithrillium_jar=Mithrillium Fortified Jars
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithrillium_jar.1=With the creation of Mithrillium, I've again come back to my old sketches of jars and the efforts I went to in shaping their lids. I'm surprised this hadn't come to me before: why not simply melt the newer metal over the old lid? Its worth testing, and with the malleability of this new blue friend of mine, there's no better place to start.
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithrillium_jar.2=So. The "melting new metal over the old one" ended with lots of charred hairs. After another attempt - making sure the lid wasn't ON the jar this time - I've managed to basically encase the old Void lid in Mithrillium, also taking it upon myself to reshape the jar's glass. With the blue metal's enhanced properties and purer essence, not only have I silenced that scary black gaze from the Void but I've also doubled the essentia storage: with both metals' pressures pushing the essentia into a denser form, the jar now fits §n1000 essentia§r!

research_name.thaumadditions:adaminite_jar=Adaminite Fortified Jars
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite_jar.1=As lovely as the Mithrillium is, I'm still always open to improvement. While the cobalt-blue metal is a strong material physically, Adaminite has proven to be strong magically. While it's insanely expensive, a few initial tests couldn't hurt...
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite_jar.2=Using a similar method as the previous upgrade, I've molded the Adaminite over the old lids and adjusted the glass again. At this point it feels more like a barrel, both in circumference and storage. The Adaminite condenses all the essentia that passes through it, doubling every bit of the storage previously in the jar. While §n2000 essentia§r is a lot, the jar is quite expensive... also, I've yet to properly test how the condensation of essentia properly works.
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite_jar.3=Using a similar method as the previous upgrade, I've molded the Adaminite over the old lids and adjusted the glass again. At this point it feels more like a barrel, both in circumference and storage. The Adaminite condenses all the essentia that passes through it, doubling every bit of the storage previously in the jar. While §n2000 essentia§r is a lot, the jar is quite expensive... also, I've yet to properly test how the condensation of essentia properly works.<LINE>§lAddendum:§r After further testing with the final prototype, I've been met with a new concern. The condensation of most aspects is fine, but condensing §oVitium§r down that much on even a testing scale has had disastrous results. If I filled this to capacity with it, it'd probably mean quite the explosion - and losing all the materials I invested into this jar.

research_name.thaumadditions:mithminite_jar=Mithminite Fortified Jars
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_jar.1=The discovery of Mithminite brings back questions of how I could possibly improve upon my designs for jars. The method of creation for Mithminite should be a sure enough sign that the old "melt some metal over the last cap" trick won't work for this...
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_jar.2=Using a somewhat replicable infusion, I've managed to create a prototype† Mithminite Jar. By infusing an old Void Jar with some Mithminite, alumentum to fuse the metals, and amber to strengthen the glass, I've created an improved jar which condenses and sponges up essentia to a capacity of §n4000 essentia§r, twice as much as the last! Not only that, but any excess past its capacity seems to... vanish. I've yet to observe quite how, but I can only assume that by infusing the original Void lid, the dark forces beyond my understanding sap off anything that I have in excess. While this does serve as a good storage and disposal solution, I'd best not pump anything of importance to me in there.<BR><BR>†I'm surprised I never got around to writing this earlier: whenever I do all these tests, I have my own minimally-effective prototypes assembled, and use some math and predictions to estimate the final result. I haven't actually §omade§r a jar capable of being used outside of experimentation, yet.

research_name.thaumadditions:aspect_combiner=Essentia Combining
research_stage.thaumadditions:aspect_combiner.1=The art of centrifugal processing is simple: spin stuff until it comes apart. But while the Centrifuge is useful and all, I've had many times I wish I could simply do the opposite. Rather than split one into two, combine two into one...
research_stage.thaumadditions:aspect_combiner.2=With the purer Mithrillium I'd discovered and a bit of §oPermutatio§r essence, I combined two aspects back into one! For a moment, at least. The fact it's possible has given me renewed optimism, and I've drafted a design for an Alchemical Aspect Combiner to better utilize Mithrillium to condense aspects together. It shouldn't be too dangerous, as long as I keep my fingers out of the mechanisms.<LINE>This one is a fairly simple machine: input the two components to either side, and the output will come out the top. I can turn it off with a redstone signal.

research_name.thaumadditions:aura_charger=Aura Charger
research_stage.thaumadditions:aura_charger.1=Progress comes at a cost, usually at the expense of the environment. My pollution has definitely done a number... perhaps its time to look into giving back to the §daura§r, instead of taking from it as I always do.
research_stage.thaumadditions:aura_charger.2=Old scribbles and papers read of "Aura Nodes", small gateways through which the §daura§r flowed. Its safe to assume that those have long since burst, the §daura§r instead infusing with reality itself now - the reason I say this is that regardless of their properties, they all radiated strongly of the aspect §oAuram§r. Which, now that I look at the name, is actually embarrassingly obvious. <LINE>By reversing my methods of harnessing §daural vis§r with the recharger, I've instead created an output: by supplying this §lAura Charger§r with enough §oAuram§r, I can recharge the local §daura§r at a rate of §l1 vis to 10 §daura§r. Not only that, but I can overcharge it to almost 3 times its maximum capacity! Though, seeing how I've already thrown off the §daura's§r balance, I should be sparing in this. Don't want to damage it further.

research_name.thaumadditions:crystal_crusher=Crystal Crusher
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_crusher.1=Look. Jumping on vis crystals is fun and all, but my legs ache and there's grains of §oCorpus§r making my shoes stink. I really should look into doing it mechanically.
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_crusher.2=After ruining a few simple mechanisms† I've got a nice schematic drawn up. If I infuse a complex arcane mechanism with one of each primal crystal, along with some materials for a frame and a dash of salt to taste*, I can create what looks like a simple press.<BR>However, this §lCrystal Crusher§r is more than it seems: the pressing mechanism directs vis flow through each primal crystal to stabilize the target crystal as it presses, fixing the issue I had of them disappearing. Of course, to run the mechanism and its crystals, it needs to draw §oMachina§r essentia from nearby sources.<BR><BR>†Note to self: despite its name, raw §oMachina§r does NOT react well with unprotected machines<BR>*As funny as the joke is, the salt isn't used for taste - it actually is used to keep the §oMachina§r from melting the precious arcane mechanism. Please do not eat the machine.

research_name.thaumadditions:aura_disperser=Aura Disperser
research_stage.thaumadditions:aura_disperser.1=As much as I enjoy the new seasonings, the Vis Salt feels under-utilized as of yet. If only I could put the effects to use without consumption...
research_stage.thaumadditions:aura_disperser.2=After some initial tests, I found that the salt worked surprisingly well simply being sprayed from a dispenser - after a bit of purification and vis reactions. The new infusion diagram attached to this page goes more in-detail, but the thought process is as follows: infuse a dispenser with a mechanism, some salt to enhance function, materials for the casing, and a powerful filter. If it works according to plan, the §lAura Disperser§r should blast the salt a small ways into the area its facing. Seeing the variety of aspects, the uses are nearly endless: effect-applying stations, farms, traps...

research_name.thaumadditions:crystal_bore=Crystal Bore
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_bore.1=The key difference between me and the mages of old is simple: my civilized ways lead me down the path of automation. One such path that I'd been considering for quite some time was the harvesting of primal vis crystals: going down into the mines is a fun but destructive process, leaving the shards with little to grow back from. Its best my new machine is adjusted away from full destruction of the crystal cluster.
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_bore.2=Surprisingly, the solution to this lied simply in the morphic resonator. Infusing this as the core of a drill-like casing, I've created a Crystal Bore, which will harvest any crystal in front of it down to a single shard without damaging it - this leaves a strong enough sample for it to regrow.<LINE>The Crystal Bore has a few important mechanics to it:<BR>-It will harvest whatever crystal it faces down to a single remaining shard. The brass used for the drill-head will probably just harmlessly scrape against anything else, and I'd rather not hurt my ears.<BR>-The Bore will require a small flow of local §daura§r as a power source, another benefit to using a morphic resonator at the core.<BR>-It will automatically move harvested crystals into most storages attached to the back of it.<BR>-A redstone signal can be applied to turn it off, if need be.

research_name.thaumadditions:crystal_water=Liquid Crystal
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_water.1=Many branches of both science and magic, especially those involving crystals, typically have some method to hasten crystal growth. Studying further into how crystallized aspects react with liquids may help me find a way to grow the crystals, or at least speed up the natural growth of primal crystals.
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_water.2=During one of many tests I accidentally dropped the emptied glass into the cauldron, accelerating my research to near completion. The §oVitreus§r reacted well with the other aspects present, blending into a shimmering blue liquid. After testing with this for a while, I found that the presence of enough Crystal Water greatly sped up crystal growth, with the only downside being that of the Crystal Water being consumed. The best reasoning I can fathom for this is that the aspects in the water act as 'nutrients' for the growing crystal: the §oVitreus§r accelerating the growth of a 'shell' and the §oDesiderium§r and §oPermutatio§r enhancing essentia solidification.<BR>I've drawn up a small diagram of the best setup for accelerating growth - One central stone to grow it on, surrounded by eight buckets of Crystal Water; what happens above or below this is irrelevant and space for automation. It's important to keep in mind though that I'll need spare Crystal Water in case the growing crystal absorbs any.

research_name.thaumadditions:enchanted_golden_apple=Enchanted Golden Apple
research_stage.thaumadditions:enchanted_golden_apple.1=Along my travels I've rarely found ancient golden apples, enchanted with magics well beyond what I've seen before. Even if I can't match the raw energy infused into those, perhaps I can at least use them as inspiration to improve upon my own golden apples?
research_stage.thaumadditions:enchanted_golden_apple.2=To my surprise, the ancient apples are actually.. disappointingly simple. By taking my original golden apple and infusing it with more gold and related aspects, I've created what most would see as a perfect copy of the more powerful, "enchanted" golden apples

research_name.thaumadditions:mob_summoning=Entity Recreation
research_stage.thaumadditions:mob_summoning.1=One of the more common hazards for explorers such as myself are "spawners" or "summoners" - cage-like machines that seem to simply bring new entities into existence. Understanding the mechanisms behind this will be beyond me for a long time, but perhaps I can create a replication of this. I'll need to study mobs and their essence in order to understand how to replicate it, so to start I'll need a 'willing' test subject.
research_stage.thaumadditions:mob_summoning.2=I've devised a device to capture not only a mob, but separate it from its basic essence/soul/spirit: the Entity Cell, which I can use to capture a mob by simply hitting it with an empty one. The next step will be to find out how this template can be used in creating duplicate mobs. The best lead I have on this is again in the ancient Totemic texts - the dark Twilight Totems seemed to be most used as summoning focal points by thaumaturges past, at least for maddened zombies and wisps...
research_stage.thaumadditions:mob_summoning.3=Success! Kind of! In my small-scale tests I managed to summon... something. By creating a makeshift cage akin to the spawners I've grown accustomed to, infused with dark magic akin to the Twilight Totem and a few other trinkets, I had a basic summoning cage. Before putting in the template and starting it up though, a slimy purple tendril - a beast of the Taint, I assume - grew out the totemic base of the cage and tore it apart! My newer design is much better fortified, with a Thaumium block at its core and a self-cleaning filter, which should prevent repeats of that mess.<LINE>First, for simplicity sake, I'll repeat this: the Entity Cell can capture any mob by punching it with one, and can then be released wherever I please. Now, from what I've seen so far, it seems that aside from the cost and a few other key bits, the Entity Summoner functions about the same as the natural spawners I've seen. As for the differences: first of all, I can easily swap out the Mob being spawned by simply inserting a new Entity Cell of my choice. Second, I can also deactivate the spawner with redstone, as with most of my machines. Third, not a difference but still an important note: it will require the same lack of light as normal spawners.<BR> The biggest and most important difference is vis cost: obviously, I can't tap into whatever dark magics create the mobs from nothing - my solution is to recreate them bit-by-bit, using all their component aspects. The summoner will draw the component vis from nearby jars, so I'll need documentation on what vis each mob will need, as well as a steady supply of said vis.

research_name.thaumadditions:puriflower=Puriflower
research_stage.thaumadditions:puriflower.1=I've been reading up on botanical works, looking at how plants interact with the world around them. While many seem to purify the air and ground around them, I've wondered if perhaps one can purify the §daura§r around it? The best places to start would have to be the vishroom and shimmerleaf, both potent in untapped vis.
research_stage.thaumadditions:puriflower.2=It does feel a little cheaty, but I've essentially just infused the already-working Totem of Dawn into a plant-like shell. Using vishrooms as a catalyst of what it should be absorbing, a shimmerleaf for the plant's structure, and a load of §oHerba§r, I've created the Puriflower. While similar in function to the Totem of Dawn, the more natural attributes of it lead it to be a cleaner process. While it takes longer to absorb §5flux§r, it does so in large bursts and has no risk of malfunction. As such, this should be a direct upgrade to the Totem of Dawn.

research_name.thaumadditions:crystal_block=Crystal Blocks
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_block.1=With how much of my work revolves around crystallized essentia, I've found myself looking into other uses, even just decorative.
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_block.2=A simple enough process, I can seal 9 vis crystals of any kind back together with just a bit of magic from the §daura§r. These crystal blocks are both decorative, and - if my research is correct - should work as another stabilizing paraphenalia to put around my infusion altars.

research_name.thaumadditions:growth_chamber=Crystal Growth Chamber
research_stage.thaumadditions:growth_chamber.1=While I've been looking into how to re-grow crystals and harvest essence, I've neglected to look into reshaping it: as of now, the only way to crystallize liquid essentia is to throw quartz slivers into it. If I could get the liquid to condense itself on a pre-existing cluster...
research_stage.thaumadditions:growth_chamber.2=I've created a device that can crystallize liquid essentia, no matter what kind. By placing a crystal block made of the same aspect, filling the machine with liquid essentia, and suppling it with vis, I can solidify the liquid essentia. This is a lossy process, taking six vis and outputting one crystal, as well as depleting the §daura§r... I'll have to look into improving the system later, but for now I can at least say the concept works.<LINE>I'll re-write it here for clarity: I supply the machine with a jar of the essentia I want to crystallize, put a crystal block of the same aspect in as a catalyst, and ensure the growth chamber has a strong supply of §daural vis§r, and it will crystallize the essentia at a 6 essentia to 1 crystal shard ratio.

research_name.thaumadditions:seal=Arcane Seals
research_stage.thaumadditions:seal.1=With the reactivity of the different aspects, I'm curious if I could perhaps... invoke them, in a way. Some of the oldest writings I've found mentioned runes and symbology, focused through 'arcane seals'. Perhaps I can work to recreate this?
research_stage.thaumadditions:seal.2=The seal itself was simple enough to create. The enchantability of gold means it reacts well with runic scripts already, so embossing the seal with it should work. Now to actually find out what to write around it...

research_name.thaumadditions:seal_symbols=Seal Symbology
research_stage.thaumadditions:seal_symbols.1=The Arcane Seal is, right now, just a fancy decoration. Making it channel magic of any sort will need some sort of invocation, similar to those used in inchanting...
research_stage.thaumadditions:seal_symbols.2=Seems I'm on the right path: by blending a vis crystal with some gold I can create a chalky substance, which lets me write runes that help channel the component aspect. With the functional space on and around the runes, there should be space for three runic circles... and with 42 aspects in combinations of three...<BR>With that immense amount of combinations, I'd best look into a simple way of reading their functions, if any actually work...

research_name.thaumadditions:seal_globe=Seal Peeking
research_stage.thaumadditions:seal_globe.1=As pretty as these seals are, I honestly can't read them, nor understand their use. I'd best look into a way to translate them, or at least read their use.
research_stage.thaumadditions:seal_globe.2=Again looking into folklores of old, ancient prophets and magicians would use globes of crystaline glass to 'predict the future'. While I obviously can't do that, this Seal Globe can use the internal resonator to roughly see the use of a seal.<LINE>Testing has led me to a feeling that's both disappointment and shame. Either most of these seals are quite literally useless, or I've not been able to write them correctly. Perhaps I'll be able to come back here later to improve this measely list. My personal tests to see which seal symbols are actually of use right now found that only<BR>§oAqua | Earth x3 | Vitreus + Herba | Instrumentum + Herba | Instrumentum + Herba + Ordo | Vacuos x3 | Praecantatio + Aer + any§r<BR>work. As for their uses --- well, I guess thats why I made the globe, isn't it? I'll need to both make sure the seal is pointing at what I want it to affect, and that I have some form of §5flux§r cleaning nearby.
##NOTE - Seeing how few functional seal symbols there are, its better to just give them the functional ones instead of letting them try all ~42 seals in a combo of any 3... that would be 11,480 potential combinations? Too many to make them choose from.

research_name.thaumadditions:totems=Totemancy
research_stage.thaumadditions:totems.1=The old texts speak again of the "Aura Nodes", more specifically how they were harnessed: some scraps of text mention "Totems", structures that harness a node they're built around, used for never-quite-understood purposes. Maybe I can try to replicate some of these old methods to focus my own §daural hot-spots§r?
research_stage.thaumadditions:totems.2=To start on reconstructing the ancient Totems, I looked into something I've already become quite talented at: polluting the §daura§r. As much as I hate to do these kinds of tests, it's simply in the name of progress. Hopefully I can find use in it, perhaps in §oVitium§r creation. Best to be careful though, lest I lose control of it.<BR> Using the magic-absorbing properties of enchanted fabric, I've created a simple totemic structure that pulls in surrounding §daura§r, which then goes through a §oVitium§r crystal as a... well, I'd say a filter, but it's the opposite, instead dirtying and corrupting the §daura§r passing through.<BR>This leads to a fascinating replacement of local §daura§r with §5flux§r - while interesting to see and a good proof-of-concept, extremely dangerous. This "Twilight Totem" is fairly unstable though, drawing and releasing §daura§r and §5flux§r in random bursts, so its best I have some sort of failsafe in place.
research_stage.thaumadditions:totems.3=To start on reconstructing the ancient Totems, I looked into something I've already become quite talented at: polluting the §daura§r. As much as I hate to do these kinds of tests, it's simply in the name of progress. Hopefully I can find use in it, perhaps in §oVitium§r creation. Best to be careful though, lest I lose control of it.<BR> Using the magic-absorbing properties of enchanted fabric, I've created a simple totemic structure that pulls in surrounding §daura§r, which then goes through a §oVitium§r crystal as a... well, I'd say a filter, but it's the opposite, instead dirtying and corrupting the §daura§r passing through.<BR>This leads to a fascinating replacement of local §daura§r with §5flux§r - while interesting to see and a good proof-of-concept, extremely dangerous. This "Twilight Totem" is fairly unstable though, drawing and releasing §daura§r and §5flux§r in random bursts, so its best I have some sort of failsafe in place.<LINE>§lCONTINUED:§r<BR>I've managed to recreate the ancient Totem of Dawn - kind of, at least. I couldn't manage one as stable as Thaumaturges past, perhaps because I don't know the same carvings and incantations they used. I can say, at least, that this Dawn Totem will be the mirror of the Twilight Totem, drawing in and purifying §5flux§r in short bursts. Though, there's a non-zero risk of spilling some back, so I shouldn't put too much faith in a single one.

research_name.thaumadditions:arcane_cake=Arcane Cake
research_stage.thaumadditions:arcane_cake.1=I've found myself struggling with my sugar binges. A whole cake, gone, again...<BR>Rather than pace myself while eating, I will now create an infinite cake, just to spite myself.
research_stage.thaumadditions:arcane_cake.2=Why is past me such a terrible person... I've never eaten so much cake in my life...... By infusing the cake with a primordial pearl and other magics, I've made it slowly but surely regenerate itself. If I leave just one slice, I'll later find the cake regrowing itself. Best not to eat the whole thing lest I waste a primordial pearl... not that I can stomach the whole thing...<BR>So... much... cake... gonna... be... sick...

research_name.thaumadditions:knowledge_tome=Tome of Sharing
research_stage.thaumadditions:knowledge_tome.1= Research has always been a large part of Thaumaturgy, but an issue arises when you attempt to work as a team: obviously, we can't all write in the same book, lest we put conflicting information or misunderstand eachother. Duplicating the book for others to read, however, should be fairly simple...<LINE>§nThis WILL require a new Thaumonomicon be used in the experiments, so it's best I collect a spare. And, if I've happened to combine mine in an §lAkashic Tome§r§n, for safety it's best to store that entirely separate, lest all my manuals get destroyed in my tests.§r
research_stage.thaumadditions:knowledge_tome.2=I've devised a common formatting to use in these Tomes of Knowledge Sharing, which will make it fairly easy to rewrite and share my findings with other Thaumaturges. The best part? The formatting will also be shared, so they can learn how to write these as well!
research_stage.thaumadditions:knowledge_tome.2_noreuse=I've devised a common formatting to use in these Tomes of Knowledge Sharing, which will make it fairly easy to rewrite and share my findings with other Thaumaturges. The best part? The formatting will also be shared, so they can learn how to write these as well!<BR>If the other Thaumaturges are anything like me, I can assume they'll tear apart the Tome to addend to their own Thaumonomicon, which means that these should be considered single-use.

research_name.thaumadditions:fragnant_pendant=Sanity Management on-the-go
research_stage.thaumadditions:fragnant_pendant.1=The Warp I occasionally inflict on myself grows... tiring, to say the least. While the cleansing effects of my soap and salt baths work wonders, they're temporary solutions and mostly restricted to my home base. I need to work on a more portable solution, for long journeys away from my spa supplies...
research_stage.thaumadditions:fragnant_pendant.2=Looking into several different folklores, incense and aroma-therapy are a powerful tool for cleansing the body, mind, and soul. With that in mind, I've used bath salts and some essentia to make sanitizing odour powder, which I can slowly release from a special pendant. This Fragrant Pendant will let me keep myself stable on long journeys away from my Arcane Spa and other purifying paraphenalia.<BR>The odour powder is interesting in that its actually scentless. However, the purity of it brings the mind back to its fondest memories, leading it to smell like favorite smells or scents associated with happy memories.

research_name.thaumadditions:chester=Chester
research_stage.thaumadditions:chester.1=Travelling a lot leads to an issue of inventory space: carrying all my gear, as well as anything I find on my adventures, eventually turns into a game of "what do I need and what can I throw down that ravine." While taming animals as pack mules could work, they're a bit unpredictable. Perhaps I can magically program something I've already created to follow me and pick up anything I can't carry?
research_stage.thaumadditions:chester.2=During most of my sketches to create a minion to follow me, my prototype Hungry Chest kept eating my quill. In response I've made it my test subject, giving it a brain and a controlling resonator. Just a bit of vis infusion and wood to reinforce it, and I have a literal pack-mule: Chester, my newest pet, will follow me to the ends of the earth. Quite literally a moving chest, Chester can be controlled by a special tool I've also written up, which reacts well with the resonator to tell him to stay or follow, as well as picking him back up if I crouch (which drops everything inside). And, most importantly, he's capable of teleporting to me if I'm ever outrunning him, so I don't have to worry about him getting too lost! Though, these small teleports have a bit of §5flux§r output, so while exploring with him is fine, I probably don't want him teleporting all around my base.

research_name.thaumadditions:vis_seeds=Growing Essentia
research_stage.thaumadditions:vis_seeds.1=While I've devised many ways to create essentia, I've yet to look back to nature for one. Other schools of magic have often let nature rebuild their resources, and perhaps it would be willing to do the same for me?
research_stage.thaumadditions:vis_seeds.2=By imbueing some seeds with §oHerba§r and an aspect of my choice, I've created an infused Essentia Seed. They seem to fruit into a kind of pod, which I can melt down to retrieve the essentia. While I'm not sure about the science of this, the process works, and I'm not one to complain. This should come in use with other tools to farm some of the harder-to-get essentia.

research_name.thaumadditions:flux_concentrator=Flux Concentrator
research_stage.thaumadditions:flux_concentrator.1=The world around me is full of magic, both in the §daura§r and physically inside... well, everything. Recreating some of the more magically-imbued plants has come as a challenge... though, perhaps the Vishroom would be easy enough to recreate? Mushrooms already tend to absorb from their environment...
research_stage.thaumadditions:flux_concentrator.2=I've designed a machine that creates localised §5flux§r pollution. Dubbed the "Flux Concentrator", this glorified fan - when supplied with §oVitium§r in its piping side - will emit gaseous §5flux§r from it's fan on the flat side. It's a fairly low-pressure system, meaning it should only blow about 16 blocks away from the Concentrator, but I shouldn't need more than that. Mushrooms placed within range of it will absorb the §5flux§r it sprays, eventually mutating into Vishrooms. I also found that pumpkins reacted well to it.

research_name.thaumadditions:vis_scribing_tools=Vis Scribing Tools
research_stage.thaumadditions:vis_scribing_tools.1=Dammit! I've had it with constantly refilling my phial with ink. I need some sort of substitute before I begin writing in my own blood.
research_stage.thaumadditions:vis_scribing_tools.2=Finally, a solution that doesnt require me to prick my finger for blood. By blending together some §oAuram§r in the ink phial and adding some specially shaped §oPraecantatio§r to the bottom and lid, I've created a way to use local §daura§r as ink. When I run out, I can simply put these Vis Scribing Tools onto a §lRecharge Pedestal§r, at which point it will use its internal buffer to liquify §daura§r into a usable ink!

research_name.thaumadditions:adaminite_fabric=Adaminite Fabric
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite_fabric.1=Adaminite metal is a miraculous material, malleable yet rigid, strong yet easy to shape... But I've found it's wildly uncomfortable to wear. Given how easy it is to work with, perhaps I can simply wrap it in a more comfortable material?
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite_fabric.2=While inefficient, I've managed to securely wrap and sew enchanted fabric around the metal. Surprisingly, the fabric absorbed the metals properties as well, effectively giving me three ultra-thin layers of the metal that I can make into a strong set of armor.

research_name.thaumadditions:mithminite_fabric=Mithminite Fabric
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_fabric.1=With how well Adaminite could be trimmed and wrapped into a fabric, I've found myself wondering if the same can be said for a metal made from it?
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_fabric.2=By flattening a Mithminite ingot to be ultra-thin and wrapping it in Adaminite Fabric, I've created what I can only call a super-material. However, the strong magic it emanates means I'll need to craft with it in less... traditional ways.

research_name.thaumadditions:mithminite_hood=Mithminite Hood
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_hood.1=Upgrading an Adaminite helmet with the Mithminite Fabric would be simple enough, but I'm curious what other tools I can attach to the helmet while I do so...
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_hood.2=Whew. After many dangerous experiments and several torn-up theories, I've managed to not only infuse the fabric into an Adaminite helmet, but I've also attached several useful tools:<BR>This new helmet should give me night vision when it's too dark, has a filter for water-breathing, built-in sanity checker, fragrant pendant, and seal globe, and with the help of a brain-in-a-jar it also auto-repairs my held tool when I pick up experience!

research_name.thaumadditions:mithminite_robe=Mithminite Robe
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_robe.1=Improving an Adaminite robe could be as simple as sewing over the old fabric, but what's the harm in a proper infusion? I could add more tools to it that way anyways.
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_robe.2=An expensive task, but a worthwhile result: this new Mithminite Robe, aside from the superior strength and defense, has a few built-in defenses and utilities:<BR>By infusing the armor with an enchanted golden apple, aggression module, and a lot of vis, it practically radiates safety and health - it will double my vitality and automatically give me full fire resistance. And, my specially-made flight device not only increases my movement speed, but actually gives me god-like flight!

research_name.thaumadditions:mithminite_belt=Mithminite Belt
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_belt.1=An upgrade to the Adaminite belt, despite not being used to do anything more than hold up my pants, may prove useful.
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_belt.2=While a technical improvement, again, the main use of this is holding up my pants. It does, however, give me a very nice speed boost, so even having it without the complete set could be worthwhile.

research_name.thaumadditions:mithminite_boots=Mithminite Boots
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_boots.1=The Adaminite boots, while very good at protecting my feet, do just that and nothing more. If I'm to upgrade them with Mithminite, I'll also want to improve them with, say the Boots of the Traveller, so its more than just armor.
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_boots.2=A perfect improvement: improved armor aside, the Mithminite reacted extraordinarily well with the Boots of the Traveller. These give me a nice speed boost, let me effortlessly step up whole blocks, and give me a jump boost, all without needing to be recharged.

research_name.thaumadditions:void_thaumometer=Void Thaumometer
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_thaumometer.1=It feels like the dark forces that seeped from the Flux Rift have corrupted my mind and soul. They drive me towards insanity attacks, I hear their whispers echo in my head... if I wanted to make any sense of them, I'd need to look closer, deeper into the rift... though I fear if I'm not careful, it may just pull me in.
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_thaumometer.2=By fastening an old thaumometer with the Void Metal, I've made my tool resonate on the same unholy frequency as that dark magic. While it scares me to look through it, lest it show me some dark knowledge of the universe, I've found one key use. Looking into Flux Rifts doesn't show me any thoughts darker than it already had... it does, however, show me the instability of the rift. Hopefully this comes of use in dealing with these tears in the §daura§r...

research_name.thaumadditions:wormhole_mirror=Wormhole Mirror
research_stage.thaumadditions:wormhole_mirror.1=Often I find myself staring into the Void, that space through which all magic flows... yet, I can only watch, bound to this realm. Perhaps, with how the Void Metal resonates with the void, it may let me peer even closer, perhaps even step inside the- no, no, what am I thinking! The voices are getting to me again...
research_stage.thaumadditions:wormhole_mirror.2=Against my better judgement, I've imbued my hand mirror with the Void Metal. Just holding it in my hand makes me feel... faded? Unstable, as if I'm not bound entirely to reality... when I tested it on one of my prototype essentia mirrors, the device went through - which is shocking, seeing that only essentia should be capable. Perhaps if I made a more stable one to use on my mirrors, I could make it take me through with it? A "Wormhole Mirror" if you will... though whatever I see in the Void is best ignored...

research_name.thaumadditions:void_crop=Growing Void
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_crop.1=The Void Seeds I recover from Flux Rifts, filling my head with dark thoughts, constantly seem to beg for more power. I can't help but be at least intrigued by their commands...
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_crop.2=Whatever I've done is beyond even the ancients. If my documentation is right - which it will be, considering the Void whispered most of it to me - then I should be able to quite literally grow Void Seeds. I can only hypothesize that these small crops can draw from the void much the same as Flux Rifts...<BR>I've also found that, besides the Void Seeds, the crops occasionally grow an actual fruit. Though, with the dark energies inside, I should probably be cautious about eating them... or should I? The Void would never treat me wrong...

research_name.thaumadditions:essentia_pistol=Essentia Pistol
research_stage.thaumadditions:essentia_pistol.1=Eating and dispersing salts has shown to be an effective way to apply effects - however, they require the target either eats seasoned food, or happens to be near the set-up machine. I'm curious how easy it would be to make it portable...
research_stage.thaumadditions:essentia_pistol.2=By using an accelerator mechanism with my already-proven Aura Disperser, I've made a handheld version capable of shooting short bursts of liquid essentia. Sneak-right-clicking this in-hand lets me attach a jar of my chosen essentia, as well as adjusting the nozzle to spray up to 20 essentia at a time. Finding an offensive use may prove to be the actual challenge, as most of the essentia I've tested with is either useless or applies buffs - which isn't exactly what I want a pistol to do.

research_name.thaumadditions:shadow_enchanter=Shadow Enchanter
research_stage.thaumadditions:shadow_enchanter.1=The magic of Enchanting is complex and unreliable. Perhaps I can replicate it in a way that lets me properly manipulate the enchantments?
research_stage.thaumadditions:shadow_enchanter.2=It turns out that by channeling the correct essentia through some resonators, and crafting a table from Mithrillium, I can choose the exact enchantments I want, as well as their strength! The process is pleasingly simple, and now XP-free.<BR>With an item in the table, I'll be able to select from all the possible enchantments it can have, as well as select their strength. After that, I need to supply the Shadow Enchanter with the correct essentia, and activate it with a casting tool. It's not the fastest, but the customizability is worth it. Plus, it seems in some cases I can go to slightly higher levels of enchantment than normal, the levels that would need an enchanted book to reach.

research_name.thaumadditions:shadow_beam_staff=Shadow Beam Staff
research_stage.thaumadditions:shadow_beam_staff.1=Mithrillium has chosen to be amazing at channeling vis of all kinds. I believe the time has come to see how it reacts with §oAlienis§r - I've always found it to react in the most peculiar ways with the world around it.
research_stage.thaumadditions:shadow_beam_staff.2=A Mithrillium charge mechanism can be used to project §oAlienis§r through a vis resonator, focusing it into a powerful beam. I was... planning on using this in further tests, but the beam alone is unique enough to use: rather than hitting a block and dispersing, the §oAlienis§r beam is instantly repelled, bouncing off of several blocks before finally losing strength. This could prove to be a strong weapon, especially in narrow corridors.<BR>I've also designed an Essentia Sink to fill the Mithrillium chamber from. With this, I can fill it with the §oAlienis§r it uses to make its beams.

research_name.thaumadditions:void_anvil=Void Anvil
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_anvil.1=Mundane Anvils constantly break and crack, unable to handle the constant hammering and heat. Though... the Void whispers to me again, reminding me how well Void Metal can withstand wear and tear...
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_anvil.2=Giving in again to the whispers of the Void, I've created a reinforced anvil, primarily made of Void Metal. While it doesn't wear or crack, no matter how often it's used, I've registered §5flux§r readings after each bang of my hammer... a necessary price to pay, I suppose...

research_name.thaumadditions:disenchant_fabric=Fabric of Disenchantment
research_stage.thaumadditions:disenchant_fabric.1=Enchanted items have proven to be very strongly bound to their magic. While the strength of this connection is fascinating, it's also annoying, leaving me with unwanted enchantments stuck to my tools. Its best I look into a way to remove them, hopefully in a way that refunds my XP.
research_stage.thaumadditions:disenchant_fabric.2=I've created a cloth that essentially lets me 'clean' enchantments off of an item. By using Salis Mundus with some enchanted fabric, I've created a fabric that's extremely absorbent when it comes to magic.<BR>Combining this Fabric of Disenchantment with my tools lets me remove all enchantments, with a slight refund. However, the fabric can only absorb so much magical potential before it unravels, breaking in my hand - giving it about 30 uses.

research_name.thaumadditions:crystal_bag=Crystal Bag
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_bag.1=The amount of crystals I find myself working with can be insane, not even taking into account the different types of them. I need a new storage solution for them that's not only easy to access, but stores enough to be of use.
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_bag.2=I've, uh, more than succeeded at storing large amounts of crystals. I'm still not quite sure what I did wrong - or, right, I guess. By infusing a dusty old foci pouch I had with some natural primal crystal clusters, primal esssentia, and some §oVacuos§r, I've created what can only be seen as the end-all of crystal storage, a singularity.<BR>Not only does it have enough space for every crystal type, but it stores seemingly endless amounts of them! It also automatically picks up any off the floor nearby while in my hotbar, so I dont have to juggle with it to store them, AND it sorts them however I please!

research_name.thaumadditions:blue_wolf=Blue Wolf
research_stage.thaumadditions:blue_wolf=Taming a wolf with a specially crafted blue bone has... well... I dont know, actually. I'd like to say it summoned this, or let the wolf be used as a host, but I dont know what "this" even is. I can only assume its some ancient experiment from one of the first Thaumaturges, perhaps a pioneer in this line of Thaumaturgy.<BR>Aside from only being male, the wolves dont seem to have anything special about them. Their fur, however, is unique: while the reason for its pattern is beyond me, the magic that made it that way is very helpful to study.

research_name.thaumadditions:the_beheader=The Beheader
research_stage.thaumadditions:the_beheader.1=Collecting the heads of my opponents, while quite grim, is something I need to learn to do more efficiently: specifically, collecting wither skulls. Perhaps I can make a weapon that's specifically designed to cut cleanly through the neck?
research_stage.thaumadditions:the_beheader.2=Fusing one of my old tools with Mithrillium has given me a good base to work off, and with some trimming and sharpening of the metal and refitting the handle, it's perfectly fit for cutting through bone - most importantly, the neck. It's also still a good axe, if I need to chop trees with it; but cutting heads is its built purpose.

research_name.thaumadditions:adaminite_sword=Adaminite Sword
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite_sword.1=While the Void Metals power is beyond comprehension, I feel I should look into upgrading the tools I've made from it... if only to stop them from whispering darkness to me...
research_stage.thaumadditions:adaminite_sword.2=As I've seen before, Adaminite fuses well with its component metal. Using lots of essentia to aid and enhance the infusion, I've made a sword thats quite powerful, but more importantly, seemingly unbreakable. This weapon may be one of the best I can come across...

research_name.thaumadditions:mithminite_scythe=Mithminite Scythe
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_scythe.1=With the improvements the new metals have given me, I wonder if Mithminite, too, can be made into a tool/weapon to surpass all others?
research_stage.thaumadditions:mithminite_scythe.2=Every test with the Mithminite has proven disappointing, but it always fell back to the handle more than the head. Nothing could stay together!<BR>My new designs are quite literally made entirely of Mithminite, at least as the frame. By assembling each component and fitting them all together, I've made a combination melee and ranged weapon: swinging the scythe collects §daural vis§r as you swing, which slides off the head and continues travelling, as if it was a flying blade. A very unique phenomenon, but one that'll prove to be very powerful for me.

research_name.thaumadditions:void_elemental_hoe=Void Hoe of Growth
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_elemental_hoe.1=Looking at my Hoe of Growth, then back at the Void Metal in my hand, I'm filled with my darkest thought yet... what if I not only improved my infused tools, but imbued them with primordial powers... I'm scared of the power this thought may hold...
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_elemental_hoe.2=Reinforcing my old Hoe of Growth with two Void Plates proved to be nothing but better... and yet, I pushed further. Using a primordial shard of any strength, I've given the Void the power of self-repairing. Drawing from the §daura§r, the metal reshapes itself back to full strength.<LINE>Just for posteritys sake, I'll re-write the functions of the infused tools, of which these Void tools mimic:<BR>Aside from its newfound self-repairing, the Void Hoe of Growth functions the same as its lesser, hoeing a 3x3 plot of land, and sacrificing durability to imbue a crop with life and accelerate its growth. Crouching while using it will make it function as a normal hoe.

research_name.thaumadditions:void_elemental_shovel=Void Shovel of the Earthmover
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_elemental_shovel.1=The Shovel of the Earthmover, while great for terraforming, only has so much durability... maybe reinforcement with the Void Metal might not be too bad... right..?
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_elemental_shovel.2=The Void Metal fit cleanly around the old shovel, but I've decided to push worryingly further. Infusing it with a primordial sample has given it a way to draw from the §daura§r and mend the metal, making it effectively unbreakable.<LINE>Just for posteritys sake, I'll re-write the functions of the infused tools, of which these Void tools mimic:<BR>Alongside its self-repair, the Void Shovel of the Earthmover can dig in a 3x3 area, making it much faster for terraforming. Right-clicking with it will place a 3x3 of whatever block I'm looking at (as long as I have them in my inventory), and holding shift will show me where it will place. Pressing G will toggle how it will be placed, and holding Shift will make it function as a normal shovel.

research_name.thaumadditions:void_elemental_pickaxe=Void Pickaxe of the Core
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_elemental_pickaxe.1=Mining is, by far, one of the most time and material intensive tasks. Even if it has major returns, I should always look to improve upon my methods... and, if I've learned anything, the Void will have my answers......
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_elemental_pickaxe.2=Strengthening my Pickaxe of the Core with Void Plates has improved its durability, but I need more. The primordial sample will let it repair itself from the §daura§r, making it near-invincible. I've also infused it with probably too much §oMetallum§r, making it more reactive with nearby metals.<LINE>Just for posteritys sake, I'll re-write the functions of the infused tools, of which these Void tools mimic:<BR>Besides its improved durability and its self-repair, the Void Pickaxe of the Core should mostly function as a normal pickaxe. However, it has two useful abilities: shift-right-clicking a block will let the pickaxe sound out any ores nearby, and the original infusion lets it mine pure clusters of ore.

research_name.thaumadditions:void_elemental_axe=Void Axe of the Stream
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_elemental_axe.1=The Axe of the Stream has proven very unique in its ability to cut the furthest logs first. If I combine this with the hunger of the Void Metal, I might be able to make a direct improvement...
research_stage.thaumadditions:void_elemental_axe.2=Rather than reinforce the axe with Void Plates, this time I've actually entirely removed the old axe head and replaced it with a double-sided Void Metal head. Why? It looks cool.<BR>Infusing a primordial shard into the axe has let it draw from the nearby §daura§r and, in a disturbing display, re-build any metal that's been worn or chipped off.<LINE>Just for posteritys sake, I'll re-write the functions of the infused tools, of which these Void tools mimic:<BR>Adding to the self repair, the Void Axe of the Stream will also cut the furthest log of a tree first, letting you essentially chop it from top to bottom, FROM the bottom. It will also draw any mined blocks towards it, and holding shift-rightclick will draw all dropped items to it. Crouching while chopping wood will act like a normal axe.

research_name.thaumadditions:traveller_belt=Belt of the Traveller
research_stage.thaumadditions:traveller_belt.1=While I've found the Boots of the Traveller are perfect for exploring, they fall short of actually protecting me from hazards or attackers. Perhaps if I could get the same effects while wearing something else...
research_stage.thaumadditions:traveller_belt.2=I honestly don't know why I didn't just do it this way at the start: by doing the same ritual as the boots but on a belt, I've made a functionally-identical bauble that won't hinder the wearing of armor.

research_name.thaumadditions:striding_belt=Striding Belt
research_stage.thaumadditions:striding_belt.1=Now that I've developed a much nicer Traveller bauble to wear, perhaps I should look into improving it?
research_stage.thaumadditions:striding_belt.2=Infusing my Travelling belt has been nothing but an improvement: using amber to strengthen it and feathers to help encourage the infusion to work how I wanted, I've directly upgraded to the Striding Belt: this will let me jump higher and move faster than the previous belt!

research_name.thaumadditions:meteor_belt=Belt of the Meteor
research_stage.thaumadditions:meteor_belt.1=The simplicity of upgrading my Belt of the Traveller into the Striding Belt makes me wonder how simple another improvement might be. Aside from the base improvements, perhaps I can also reverse its ability to make me go up... and use it to come down.
research_stage.thaumadditions:meteor_belt.2=The belt is an explosive success - quite literally. Aside from being a direct upgrade to the Striding Belt in speed and jump height, crouching in mid-air will let me propel down at high speeds - and, using some §oIgnis§r, most of my impact will become an explosion around me. It's a small explosion that doesn't damage blocks, but it's a very good opener for combat with multiple enemies. However, it doesn't negate all fall damage, so I'd best not jump from too high without protection still.

research_name.thaumadditions:crystal_lamp=Crystal Lamp
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_lamp.1=I was thinking of making a light source based on vis crystals that I have. I should try channeling their energy into photons somehow. Perhaps Greatwood might be a good housing for it.
research_stage.thaumadditions:crystal_lamp.2=Nitor encased in Greatwood seems to do the trick just nicely. The real miracle happens when I put the Vis Crystal into the lamp. It should start glowing. The new invention also seems to react to redstone, turning itself off when it gets powered.
