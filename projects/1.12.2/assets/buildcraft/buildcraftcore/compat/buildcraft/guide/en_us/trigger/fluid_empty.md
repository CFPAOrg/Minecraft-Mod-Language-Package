<chapter name="Requirements"/>
When selected, the connected actions will only be activated when all of the connected tank has zero fluid in.

Gates may show the Tank Empty trigger multiple times in different colours to represent each of the different connected tanks.
The colour of the Trigger represents the direction on the tank in relation of the pipe so you can differentiate between each tank.
