<chapter name="Requirements"/>
When the action is activated, the machine will repeatedly complete its operating cycle over and over again.
Note: Not all machines support the Loop action.

<chapter name="Trigger directions"/>
Gates may show the Loop action multiple times in different colours to represent each of the different connected machines.
The colour of the action represents the direction of the machine in relation of the pipe so you can differentiate between each machine.
