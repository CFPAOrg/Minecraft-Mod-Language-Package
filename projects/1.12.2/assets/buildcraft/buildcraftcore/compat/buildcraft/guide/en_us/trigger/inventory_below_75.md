<chapter name="Requirements"/>
When selected, the connected actions will only be activated when the connected inventory is at less than 75% capacity.

<chapter name="Parameters"/>
When Contains less than 75% and the gate installed has parameters available, the Filter slots next to it becomes available as a parameter.
Placing Items in the filter slots allows you check if the inventory has less than 75% of the items selected in filters slots before triggering.

<chapter name="Trigger directions"/>
Gates may show the Contains less than 75% trigger multiple times in different colours to represent each of the different connected inventories.
The colour of the Trigger represents the direction on the inventory in relation of the pipe so you can differentiate between each inventory.
