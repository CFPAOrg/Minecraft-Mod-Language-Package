<chapter name="Requirements"/>
When selected, the connected actions will only be activated when the adjacent engine is at its blue temperature stage.

Gates may show the Engine Blue trigger multiple times in different colours to represent each of the different connected engines.
The colour of the Trigger represents the direction of the engine in relation of the pipe so you can differentiate between each engine.
