<chapter name="Requirements"/>
When selected, the connected actions will only be activated when the connected tank is at less than 75% capacity.

<chapter name="Parameters"/>
When Contains less than 75% and the gate installed has parameters available, the Filter slot next to it becomes available as a parameter.
Placing a fluid container in the filter slot allows you check if the tank has less than 75% of the fluid selected in the filter slot before triggering.

<chapter name="Trigger directions"/>
Gates may show the Contains less than 75% trigger multiple times in different colours to represent each of the different connected tanks.
The colour of the Trigger represents the direction on the tank in relation of the pipe so you can differentiate between each tank.
