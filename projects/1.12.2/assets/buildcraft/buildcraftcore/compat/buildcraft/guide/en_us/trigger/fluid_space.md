<chapter name="Requirements"/>
When selected, the connected actions will only be activated when the connected tank has space to receive anymore fluid.

<chapter name="Parameters"/>
When Space for Fluid and the gate installed has parameters available, the Filter slot next to it becomes available as a parameter.
Placing a fluid container in the filter slot allows you check if there are any that can accept the fluid selected in filter before triggering.

<chapter name="Trigger directions"/>
Gates may show the Space for Fluid trigger multiple times in different colours to represent each of the different connected tanks.
The colour of the Trigger represents the direction of the tank in relation of the pipe so you can differentiate between each tank.
