<chapter name="Requirements"/>
When selected, the connected actions will only be activated when the connected inventory has slots empty to accept items in.

<chapter name="Parameters"/>
When Space in Inventory and the gate installed has parameters available, the Filter slots next to it becomes available as a parameter.
Placing Items in the filter slots allows you check if the inventory has any empty slots or incomplete slots that can accept the items selected in filters slots before triggering.

<chapter name="Trigger directions"/>
Gates may show the Space in Inventory trigger multiple times in different colours to represent each of the different connected inventories.
The colour of the Trigger represents the direction of the inventory in relation of the pipe so you can differentiate between each inventory.
