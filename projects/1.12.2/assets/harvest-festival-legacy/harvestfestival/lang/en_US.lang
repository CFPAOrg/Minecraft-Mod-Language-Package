harvestfestival.npc.katlin.gift.reject=You've already given me something today youngun.
harvestfestival.npc.katlin.festival.chicken1=A happy chicken makes a happy home. Or was it a happy wife makes a happy life?
harvestfestival.npc.katlin.festival.chicken2=I remember someone telling me once that chickens like to roost on a pole off the ground. I wonder why that is...
harvestfestival.npc.katlin.festival.cooking1=Each year is always the same. I hear the young'ns quibbling about what to cook to impress the town.
harvestfestival.npc.katlin.festival.cooking2=You know what wins each year? I'll never tell you.
harvestfestival.npc.katlin.festival.cow1=In my day, you made your butter and cream with a hand churn.
harvestfestival.npc.katlin.festival.cow2=Milk didn't used to be processed before selling. Some of us would drink it right from the bucket.
harvestfestival.npc.katlin.festival.harvest1=For as long as I can remember, the harvest festival takes place in the autumn, and it always includes food. Its not for the Goddess's birthday though.
harvestfestival.npc.katlin.festival.harvest2=Its getting colder. I should knit a new scarf and a pair of mittens.
harvestfestival.npc.katlin.festival.new.years.eve1=When the new year comes, open the front door. When the old year leaves, open the back door and close it after it leaves.
harvestfestival.npc.katlin.festival.new.years.eve2=Its traditional to do a toast at midnight. To good health, long life, and happiness dearie.
harvestfestival.npc.katlin.festival.new.years1=Open the front door to let in the new year, open the back door to let out the old year.
harvestfestival.npc.katlin.festival.new.years2=Happy New Year dear. I wish you wealth, good health, and happiness.
harvestfestival.npc.katlin.festival.sheep1=You can tell the quality of a sheep's wool by touching them, you know. Same way you get the feeling of a good yarn, its by touching them. Feeling it between your fingers.
harvestfestival.npc.katlin.festival.sheep2=If they shear the prize winning sheep, I might buy some wool to spin for a project. A nice autumnal dye...
harvestfestival.npc.katlin.festival.starry.night1=I remember when Tomas invited me to dinner one Starry Night. I'm sad to say he chose that night to ask for a divorce. This festival is not my favorite for that reason. Brings a tear to my eye every now and than each year.
harvestfestival.npc.katlin.festival.starry.night2=Do consider inviting Liara to dinner though. She enjoys this season so much.

#Danieuru/Chylex
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.shop=I'm open every day of the week except for Thursdays from 10:00 to 16:00.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.greeting1=I've always loved tinkering around since I was a child.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.greeting2=Tools really are my passion, they are a Hardcore Expansion to my life.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.greeting3=People call me crazy around here for believing in Dragons. They'll see them when they reach The End, and they'll no longer call me a fool.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.greeting4=If I could do anything other than playing with tools, I'd be a dragon slayer.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.greeting5=Did you know that I used to be an olympic sprinter back in my youth? I was better than everyone else in Minecraftia.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.greeting6=Males, Females? Don't bother me, I like them all. Variety is the spice of life.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.greeting7=I've really taken a shine for Jenni and Yulif lately but neither seem to be all that interested.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.greeting8=If you need your tools repaired, just bring me the right material and tool.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.greeting9=If you ever need an upgrade, just bring me a 100%% tool, some gold and something to upgrade it with.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.greeting10=I've been to The End have you?
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.greeting11=I became a blacksmith because I wanted to make my own tools, so I could get to the ender, it really was a life long dream.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.greeting12=If I could visit any country, hmm, I'd probably visit Czechia with Ashlee.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.greeting13=There's nothing I hate more than the ocean. I reckon it's related to my fascination with Ender.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.marriage.reject=I'd rather spend my time polishing my tools than with you.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.marriage.accept=My tools can wait, we must get married at once!
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.gift.awesome=And I thought the end was the best thing I experienced.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.gift.good=You give great gifts.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.gift.decent=It's alright.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.gift.dislike=It's not alright.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.gift.bad=You give bad gifts.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.gift.terrible=And I thought the rejection from Yulif was bad enough, now you give me this?
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.festival.chicken1=Chickens and I have one thing in common; we both hate water and being out in the rain.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.festival.chicken2=Stories say in other places, there are chickens out there who lay ender pearls. Where can I get a chicken like that?
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.festival.cooking1=I tried crushing an ender pearl on the anvil once to experiment with if it was edible as a powder or not. ...I ended up with food poisoning and problems with glass shards.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.festival.cooking2=Its put me off of doing any sort of cooking experiments since.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.festival.cow1=Jim needs to sell his own animal supplies. I can supply more tools that way.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.festival.cow2=A dragon's favorite meal is a cow. Or a sheep. Usually sheep though.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.festival.harvest1=Is there any more food?
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.festival.harvest2=I'm not a farmer, but the soup cauldron is quality iron. I can see it from here.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.festival.new.years.eve1=This next year will be the year I track down the elusive end portal. Nobody will call me a fool when I bring back that loot in the cities in the End.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.festival.new.years.eve2=Rumor has it the End people have come up with propelled flight. An ‘elytra', and you can fly with rockets and fireworks to propel you around. Or a bow with punch? Do some research, get back to me.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.festival.new.years1=Dragons are good luck on New years. Will they visit our town?
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.festival.new.years2=I don't think anyone would approve of putting a sheep out at midnight in front of that dog statue to attract one though.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.festival.sheep1=I did sell shears in my shop once, but Jim decided to finally sell his own supplies. I don't repair shears though.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.festival.sheep2=Its smart to sharpen your shears before shearing your animal, it makes for a smoother cut, and a cleaner shear.
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.festival.starry.night1=Should I ask Yulif or Jenni to dinner? They aren't very interested... -sigh-
harvestfestival.npc.daniel.festival.starry.night2=You keep finding me at the cafe in the mornings, but I'm happier just remaining at the forge.

#Cloe
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.greeting1=A good book, makes a girl happy.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.greeting2=My dad, he's just too much sometimes, I can't handle the pressure.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.greeting3=I just don't understand girls sometimes.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.greeting4=Nothing I enjoy more than a scary movie!
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.greeting5=Honestly, I'm not really sure what I want to do with my life right now.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.greeting6=This world is so messed up, I just don't know anymore.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.greeting7=I read 200 books by the time I was five.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.greeting8=I don't know how Abii can put up with all that cuteness, it's so fake, it drives me crazy.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.greeting9=We are so insignificant.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.greeting10=Please don't tell anyone. But I like Penguins. I know, I know.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.greeting11=My Uncle well he's a bit weird... He spends most of his time at his desk, just working on well, I don't know what. I think he said something about modding. Maybe one day he'll get a life.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.greeting12=I can't believe my mother chose Team Valor.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.marriage.reject=Why would i ever want to get married, it's a waste of time.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.marriage.accept=I am ready to grow up, and spend my life with you.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.gift.awesome=You really are after my heart aren't you.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.gift.good=I appreciate the kind gift.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.gift.decent=Thanks.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.gift.dislike=Err, what?
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.gift.bad=Err, no thanks...
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.gift.terrible=I thought my parents were the worst, but nope it's you.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.festival.chicken1=Have you ever peeled a chicken's foot? Its very difficult to do.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.festival.chicken2=You can eat almost every part of a chicken, except for the beak, I believe. Why you would want to though... don't ask me.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.festival.cooking1=Did you know bone marrow is what gelatin is made of?
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.festival.cooking2=I've got a few moulds to make jiggly gelatin shapes for Abii. She loves them.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.festival.cow1=Some breeds of cows grow these massive sets of bone horns right out of their heads.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.festival.cow2=All the cows Jim's ranch sells have no horns though. I wonder why.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.festival.harvest1=You can boil down bones to make a decent soup stock.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.festival.harvest2=Jade makes the soup each year. She never says what her secret ingredient is that she adds. I add a bone every now and than, but it has to be fished out.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.festival.new.years.eve1=Mm, didn't get too good of marks on my civic service exam. New Year's isn't exactly interesting anyways. Go get noodles, stay up late... whatever.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.festival.new.years.eve2=We should get something more interesting to do, like watch scary movies till midnight.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.festival.new.years1=The world didn't end when the calendar turned over. I guess thats good.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.festival.new.years2=It took a whole pot of coffee to be able to come outside with it this cold.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.festival.sheep1=Sheep horns curl around their ears. But they're made of bone and hollow.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.festival.sheep2=Baaaah, humbug. I'm going back to sleep. There's no dark sheep to be seen.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.festival.starry.night1=Uh... hello.
harvestfestival.npc.cloe.festival.starry.night2=Don't forget whomever you ended up inviting is bringing their family along.

#Liara/ApsciLiara
harvestfestival.npc.liara.shop=I'm afraid the cafe is only open from half past nine in the morning to five in the evening, but we're open every day of the week!
harvestfestival.npc.liara.greeting1=I really love this weather, perfect time to bake a cake!
harvestfestival.npc.liara.greeting2=Cooking is what I enjoy the most! I love seeing the smile on someone's face as they take their first bite of my delicious dishes!
harvestfestival.npc.liara.greeting3=Are you feeling hungry? I'm always hungry, no wonder I like to cook so much.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.greeting4=Make sure to drop by the cafe on Tuesdays, there's always something special.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.greeting5=Food makes the world go round, and it makes me giddy.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.greeting6=There's nothing like a good ol piece of a chocolate to make a girl happy.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.greeting7=You wouldn't believe it, but I'm really in to, well spacey stuff.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.greeting8=If you're looking for cookware, I only sell them on Sundays.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.greeting9=I sell different recipes each week, and season.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.greeting10=If you didn't know, you can cook meat in the oven.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.greeting11=If you want my advice, read the descriptions in the recipe book. Often they'll give you a little hint at what makes a recipe better.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.greeting12=When I went to cookery school, there was this girl I knew, I think her name began with a p. She really was a terrible cook.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.greeting13=I really do miss my parents, but losing them really made me want to focus on my cooking career.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.greeting14=I've been passionate about cooking all my life, I remember when I was ten, I was selling cupcake and making 1000 gold a week! But now I'm so glad I finally get to open my own proper business.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.marriage.reject=The cafe is my home. I do not wish to live with you.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.marriage.accept=Thank you, I will marry you, I will cook you many meals.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.gift.awesome=Thank you so so much, this will be remembered forever.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.gift.good=Thank you very much.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.gift.decent=Thank you.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.gift.dislike=No thank you.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.gift.bad=I do not enjoy this.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.gift.terrible=I would thank you, but you have given me the worst thing anyone could give me. Goodbye.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.festival.chicken1=You can keep your eggs on the counter as long as they aren't washed with soap. It takes off the protective coating on the eggshells and they go bad much quicker.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.festival.chicken2=Chickens fed different choices of feed and let outside each day produce better eggs, I've found. Nice rich yellow yolks. Best omelettes I've ever made.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.festival.cooking1=Can you believe how few people know how to hold a knife properly when slicing or chopping?!
harvestfestival.npc.liara.festival.cooking2=A light lemon cream sauce is going to make whatever dish I make. Lemon is strong, but delicious. The juice makes a good addition to dishes too.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.festival.cow1=Not every chocolate has milk in it, did you know? Its not considered chocolate in my book without milk in it.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.festival.cow2=I wonder what you need to feed a cow in order for her to produce chocolate milk...
harvestfestival.npc.liara.festival.harvest1=It isn't just a lunch, it is a harvest meal. It would go well with a freshly picked salad from the cafe.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.festival.harvest2=There's just no telling whether or not the soup turns out well until we taste it. I always add the same thing though.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.festival.new.years.eve1=I'd love to hold a cooking class next year. Even for something as simple as cupcakes. Would you be interested in that %4$s?
harvestfestival.npc.liara.festival.new.years.eve2=Plain noodles are very boring; I'm trying mine with a light lemon cream sauce. It goes well against heavier dishes, like chicken picatta and eggplant parmasan.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.festival.new.years1=Mm mmm! I'm in the mood to make some new year food. Dumplings, wonton soup, rice soup, rice pudding...
harvestfestival.npc.liara.festival.new.years2=Only downside to spring, the lack of winter berries.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.festival.sheep1=The one festival I'd rather sleep through, or work in the cafe. Nothing but sheep, wool, and yarn. And a lot of baaabling.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.festival.sheep2=Now if you want to talk about dishes made with lamb, or with mutton, I'm all ears.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.festival.starry.night1=Winter calls for a nice hearty stew. Plenty of root vegetables and meats... I'm getting hungry thinking about it.
harvestfestival.npc.liara.festival.starry.night2=You know %4$s, you can invite someone to the park to have dinner. They might invite their family. Like... if you invited me, I would invite Granny Katlin, see?

#Jade
harvestfestival.npc.jade.buy1=These flowers are perfect for my collection, here take this small token.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.buy2=You really are helping me out greatly to get my store setup.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.buy3=Amazing, even more flowers!
harvestfestival.npc.jade.buyno1=Umm, are you sure these are flowers?
harvestfestival.npc.jade.buyno2=Not quite what I'm looking for, for my store.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.buyno3=Yeah this is not a flower.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.greeting1=Hey! I just love going out in to the world, watch out for the sheep though!
harvestfestival.npc.jade.greeting2=The sky is falling, the sky is falling!
harvestfestival.npc.jade.greeting3=I would just love to own a farm, but my brother is such a control freak!
harvestfestival.npc.jade.greeting4=So many people have called me evil, but I'm a nice girl really.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.greeting5=I wish I owned a cat, but Yulif hates them.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.greeting6=It can get really tight in my house, not much room to move about.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.greeting7=I would really like to start selling flowers, but I heard that's for a future update, whatever that means?
harvestfestival.npc.jade.greeting8=It really is quite cramped in our home.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.greeting9=You may have noticed some rocks, weeds and sticks laying around, you can break these for some stone or logs. You'll need to get a hammer or axe though.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.greeting10=The quickest way to anyones heart is giving them gifts. In fact if you make them like you enough, they may just give you something back!
harvestfestival.npc.jade.greeting11=Sleeping is the quickest way to grow your crops.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.greeting12=I'm really not sure why you can't fertilise your crops. Maybe one day?
harvestfestival.npc.jade.greeting13=Remember that that grass and wheat need a sickle in order to be harvested.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.marriage.reject=Marriage isn't something I'm after at this stage.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.marriage.accept=Marriage is something I'm ready for, I accept.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.gift.awesome=It really is an awesome gift!
harvestfestival.npc.jade.gift.good=What a good present!
harvestfestival.npc.jade.gift.decent=I appreciate this.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.gift.dislike=I can not appreciate this.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.gift.bad=What a bad present!
harvestfestival.npc.jade.gift.terrible=It really is a terrible gift!
harvestfestival.npc.jade.festival.chicken1=Chicken is good to eat, the original white meat.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.festival.chicken2=Our town's birds are more bred for egg production than meat though. Johan might have meat bird eggs if you trade him some of your small, medium or large eggs.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.festival.cooking1=I love cooking, %4$s! Are you going to enter the Cooking Festival?
harvestfestival.npc.jade.festival.cooking2=A hot dish, a cold dish, something sweet, something savoury... so many choices. Then there's the type of meal!
harvestfestival.npc.jade.festival.cow1=I keep going out in the pastures to pick any flowers I see before the cows come out to graze. They have no appreciation of flowers like I do. Or cats.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.festival.cow2=We need a cat festival. Than the milk would have more use.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.festival.harvest1=What a  beautiful day it is today. Do you intend to add to our community soup?
harvestfestival.npc.jade.festival.harvest2=Its a little different each year, so I can't guarantee the flavor. Only edible items though. No cobblestone, or wood, or seeds.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.festival.new.years.eve1=I've been making paper flowers to float on the water of the goddess pond. Each flower someone will write a new year's wish on, and they'll float away. Would you like to write down a wish?
harvestfestival.npc.jade.festival.new.years.eve2=I hope the next year is profitable for you!
harvestfestival.npc.jade.festival.new.years1=Ooooh, Happy New Year! Have a riceball! Try it with some soy sauce!
harvestfestival.npc.jade.festival.new.years2=Its so nice to see flowers blooming.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.festival.sheep1=Sheep take such a long time to regrow their wool before you can shear them again. I wonder if they ever produce more than one item ever per shearing?
harvestfestival.npc.jade.festival.sheep2=Don't mention copper to Jim when he's around his sheep. I don't remember why.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.festival.starry.night1=I might be able to get some mistletoe if I go exploring in the forest. The poor trees though don't like mistletoe.
harvestfestival.npc.jade.festival.starry.night2=Have you seen any snowberries about?

#Jenni/Othlon
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.shop=Heya friend, just to remind you, we're open everyday except Wednesday and Sunday, from 9am to 5pm. Oh Saturdays we are only open from 11am to 3pm.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.shop.wednesday=Heya friend, just to remind you, we're now open every day except for Sunday, from 9am to 5pm. Oh Saturdays we are only open from 11am to 3pm.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.greeting1=Hey my good friend, make sure to come to me if you need any general goods!
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.greeting2=As much as I love my customers, I love my art so much more.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.greeting3=Don't tell anybody but I'm secretly a huge fan of Belly Dancing.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.greeting4=Sometimes I wish I would open on Sundays, but then I remember how much I love a good lie in.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.greeting5=Granny Katlin sure makes a mean soup!
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.greeting6=My prices are the best in the town, noone can beat ol' jenni's bargains.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.greeting7=I couldn't help but notice you're from Australia. Oh, you aren't? Or are you?
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.greeting8=I'd have to say this store is my greatest accomplishment I am so proud.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.greeting9=Candice and I used to be a lot closer, but things changed. We're still living together because I just couldn't afford the rent for this place on my own.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.greeting10=In my spare time I love a bit of arts and crafts.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.greeting11=My favourite animals are pigs, and my favourite fruit are cherries.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.greeting12=My supplies are pretty limited, but one day I should be able to sell you more things.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.marriage.reject=We're not quite there yet.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.marriage.accept=My dear friend, I am now your dear wife.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.gift.awesome=My good friend this is just perfect, I aboslutely LOVE it!
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.gift.good=You truly are a good friend.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.gift.decent=A good friend, you are.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.gift.dislike=Thanks, I guess, my friend, but you could have done better.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.gift.bad=I guess you did okay, although this does upset me.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.gift.terrible=I did not think you could ever offend me, but you have now, why?
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.festival.chicken1=Such good birdies. Spare feathers always add a bit of pizazz for a craft project.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.festival.chicken2=I love the taste of the food our town's eggs make. Liara's cakes especially.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.festival.cooking1=If you're in need of cooking supplies, the general store is your one stop shop.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.festival.cooking2=If you see Candice walking around offering out hot milk... don't take it. Its a trap.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.festival.cow1=I don't like how the cattle have to stand still so long while being milked. Isn't it stressful for them?
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.festival.cow2=Candice always keeps the fridge supplied with fresh milk from the dairy. Claims to milk them herself.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.festival.harvest1=A pinch of this, a dash of that, and swish it all about...
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.festival.harvest2=A splash of oil, a few sprigs of chamomile and voila, a beautiful soup. Oh hello!
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.festival.new.years.eve1=It helps to use a flat edge to smooth out the folds in your paper flower. See that crisp edge? Its a bit sharp, but holds its shape while floating in the water. I can test a smaller flower in the well before going to make my actual flower.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.festival.new.years.eve2=My new year resolution is to grow my inventory of stock to sell to you and the town. Perhaps increase my choice of seeds.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.festival.new.years1=Happy New Year!
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.festival.new.years2=If I had my way, we would be having a dumpling bar for lunch, and a beef pot for dinner. The mayor would have a fit for the price!
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.festival.sheep1=Wool sells well alone, but there should be a way to spin it for yarn. Yarn sells very well. Granny Katlin would be your best customer.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.festival.sheep2=They're pickier than goats, but I've seen a flock of sheep mow down a hill of grass. It was like watching a baaing cloud.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.festival.starry.night1=Its too cold to grow any crops, so I don't carry any winter seeds yet in my shop.
harvestfestival.npc.jenni.festival.starry.night2=As fall ended, I saw somewhere that someone wove a basket shaped like a horn and filled it with food. I wish I could've gotten a closer look.

#Jaimii
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.greeting1=This is my town, and you remember that.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.greeting2=My family has won the town elections for the last 100 years.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.greeting3=My two girls are so precious to me, if you ever hurt either of them.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.greeting4=It's really hard being mayor, the people just love you too much.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.greeting5=Heya %4$s, have you seen my house, it's far too small.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.greeting6=In the future, I'll be hosting some contests, but for now, I'm just happy to run this town.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.greeting7=I'm not sure who put you in charge of building this town, I would have done a much better job.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.greeting8=My father always told me I would amount to everything. And look at me.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.greeting9=I should probably tell you about how Katlin broke Tomas' heart, but well she's just cold hearted, nothing more to say.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.greeting10=My family has been mayor for countless generations, noone could do this job better.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.greeting11=I'm not sure why I have to pay for all these things for others. It's my money.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.greeting12=I really hope Cloe grows up. She's really making my family look bad.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.gift.awesome=Finally you actually gave me something acceptable.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.gift.good=I guess it will do, just.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.gift.decent=And you think I like this?
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.gift.dislike=You insult my family name with this gift.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.gift.bad=This is quite possibly one of the worst things you could have given me.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.gift.terrible=That's it, If I have full authority I would banish you from this town. You insult me, you insult my family, your tarnish this town. Do not try this ever again.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.gift.no=You may not be the best person in this town. But even I cannot accept this gift. It is far too valuable.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.festival.chicken1=Ashlee pays good money for use of the festival grounds for this hideous festival. The money I make from the rental fee of the grounds is the ONLY good thing about it.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.festival.chicken2=Get that hideous feathered creature away from me!
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.festival.cooking1=This festival is too early. The matsutake mushrooms are not in season yet.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.festival.cooking2=Cloe and Abii seem eager for this waste of a competition.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.festival.cow1=All these droppings. Yuck. And they are eating every bit of grass in the park.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.festival.cow2=All they do is eat, and chew, and have long purple tongues that eat anything. So inefficient.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.festival.harvest1=The town soup is never good. Something always spoils it. What did you add to it anyways.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.festival.harvest2=All thats ever added is vegetables. Can't there be more variety in this. -sniff-
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.festival.new.years.eve1=Taxes are right around the corner. Than the money flows in, heh heh.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.festival.new.years.eve2=I only allow Abii and Cloe to stay up late if their school marks are acceptable to me.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.festival.new.years1=Its not worth my time to be out on such a festival. Paperwork is piling up as I stand here, I can feel it.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.festival.new.years2=The girls wanted to stay up late, so Tomas stayed up with them, bless his soul. If he has one.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.festival.sheep1=I noticed that nobody keeps their sheep around for very long. Do they only keep the lambs about?
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.festival.sheep2=I've tasted rack of lamb before; a succulent and juicy cut of meat. Oh I'm sorry, I said that out loud.
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.festival.starry.night1=Stay away from my Cloe, do you understand me?!
harvestfestival.npc.jamie.festival.starry.night2=On the other hand, you can TRY to invite her. But don't get too sad when she dumps you on the pathway. Don't leave any bloodstains on my doorstep.

#Abii
harvestfestival.npc.abi.greeting1=Ooo, so cute. What's that? OMG!
harvestfestival.npc.abi.greeting2=Hello big person! Where've you been?
harvestfestival.npc.abi.greeting3=I've missed you!
harvestfestival.npc.abi.greeting4=Oh my, you're so big!
harvestfestival.npc.abi.greeting5=My mummy is so mean. :(
harvestfestival.npc.abi.greeting6=I want to be a princess!
harvestfestival.npc.abi.greeting7=Fenn never notices me, I want him to love me!
harvestfestival.npc.abi.greeting8=Daddy told me that if I'm good, I can have a pony.
harvestfestival.npc.abi.greeting9=I love my big sister Cloe!
harvestfestival.npc.abi.greeting10=I never want to grow up!
harvestfestival.npc.abi.greeting11=Come play with me!
harvestfestival.npc.abi.greeting12=I want a bunny rabbit, sooo cute.
harvestfestival.npc.abi.greeting13=WOW you're really tall!
harvestfestival.npc.abi.greeting14=Do you wanna play with me?
harvestfestival.npc.abi.greeting15=My parents told me not to talk to strangers...!
harvestfestival.npc.abi.gift.awesome=I LOVE it! I LOVE it! Thank you!
harvestfestival.npc.abi.gift.good=Oooo, I really like this.
harvestfestival.npc.abi.gift.decent=Aww, so nice.
harvestfestival.npc.abi.gift.dislike=Hmm, not so nice.
harvestfestival.npc.abi.gift.bad=Awww, I didn't want this.
harvestfestival.npc.abi.gift.terrible=What? I HATE it, I HATE it. So mean!
harvestfestival.npc.abi.festival.chicken1=Chickies! So cute! How many chickies are coming to play today?
harvestfestival.npc.abi.festival.chicken2=Mama hates animals, but I go out to see them when she's not looking. Mama gets so angry when I have feathers in my hair.
harvestfestival.npc.abi.festival.cooking1=Its so fun, all the yummy food to poke your fingers in!
harvestfestival.npc.abi.festival.cooking2=If I ask nice, Mr.Jakob makes me fishie fingers!
harvestfestival.npc.abi.festival.cow1=Moo! Moo! I'm a cow!
harvestfestival.npc.abi.festival.cow2=Cows are so big! Bigger than me! They like being patted though.
harvestfestival.npc.abi.festival.harvest1=Mmm, soup smells yummy.
harvestfestival.npc.abi.festival.harvest2=Can I put some candy in the soup?
harvestfestival.npc.abi.festival.new.years.eve1=I get to stay up late... I get to stay up late...
harvestfestival.npc.abi.festival.new.years.eve2=Do you get to make a wish with Jade's pretty flowers? I wished for a pretty dress!
harvestfestival.npc.abi.festival.new.years1=New year, new year, have a happy new year!
harvestfestival.npc.abi.festival.new.years2=Did you want to be taller when the year ended? I did!
harvestfestival.npc.abi.festival.sheep1=OMG look at the cloud sheeps! One sheep, two sheep, three sheep, four sheep!
harvestfestival.npc.abi.festival.sheep2=Your sheep's nose is so soft! Eek, it licked me!
harvestfestival.npc.abi.festival.starry.night1=Look at my cute dress for dinner!
harvestfestival.npc.abi.festival.starry.night2=Mama and Papa and sissy are all dressed up too. Are you going to come to dinner?

#Tiberius/WayofTime
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.time=Looks like you've been in this town for %s years.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.first=This is your first year in the town! Why do you even need to ask.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.greeting1=Time is a fascinating thing, one second it's going slow then the next hour it's passing by faster than light!
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.greeting2=When I was a child my favourite nursery rhyme was hickory dickory dock.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.greeting3=What time is it?
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.greeting4=My favourite season is spring, as that's when a new year starts!
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.greeting5=I've never understood why some people are afraid of blood, I had a friend who delved in to Sanguimancy, he almost took over the world, shame he was caught redhanded before he got away with it. I guess it's just not the time for it.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.greeting6=If you knew what I got up to. You would be shocked.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.greeting7=I think the last time I went a|Way was when Fenn was just a baby, it's been a long time.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.greeting8=Fenn can really be a lot of trouble some time. That boy needs some discipline.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.greeting9=The one thing I can tell you about time, is that if you gift someone on their birthday, they will like you even more.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.greeting10=How long have you been in this town?
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.greeting11=I think I always found the Ancient Egyptian time period to be the most annoying.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.greeting12=I'm hoping my brother will move to town one day, he has a fascination for bees.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.marriage.reject=I'm not quite ready to marry yet.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.marriage.accept=I am ready to become your husband.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.gift.awesome=I find this a wonderful gift. There is nothing better in the world.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.gift.good=This gift is very good.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.gift.decent=You are kind.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.gift.dislike=You are not so kind.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.gift.bad=This gift is very bad.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.gift.terrible=I find this a terrible gift. There is nothing worse in the world.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.festival.chicken1=Rise in the morning to the crow of the rooster.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.festival.chicken2=I wonder how daylight savings time affects the roosters...
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.festival.cooking1=The cooking part of the festival itself is quite a sight. How much time and effort goes into each dish.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.festival.cooking2=Oh, its unusual to be watching someone cook raw steaks?
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.festival.cow1=For such big animals, cows don't produce much blood.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.festival.cow2=Apparently most of their blood flows through the udders.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.festival.harvest1=The key to any good dish is time for cooking. Too little, and it doesn't finish cooking through. Too much, and the dish burns.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.festival.harvest2=My clocks are not good for timers I'm afraid. I have heard of a mystical hourglass that can be calibrated though.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.festival.new.years.eve1=The blood moon rarely comes out on New Years Eve. What is that, you ask? The moon turns orangey-red, its a kind of eclipse.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.festival.new.years.eve2=This is the one night I allow my son to stay up late.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.festival.new.years1=With each passing year, that wives tale of the end of the world when the calendar runs out is debunked.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.festival.new.years2=Its difficult to get Fenn to go to bed before the New Year.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.festival.sheep1=Throughout the history of time, sheep have been there. At least their wool has.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.festival.sheep2=Though they are said to attract werewolves if left in front of a wolf altar on the night of the full moon. If one wants to catch the wolf, you have to set a specific silver-laid trap.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.festival.starry.night1=This particular event is a bittersweet time for me, %4$s. Fenn enjoys a family meal, but he occasionally asks if his mother is coming too. She left me, see.
harvestfestival.npc.tiberius.festival.starry.night2=If you wish, we would join you for the dinner in the park.

#Jakob
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.shop=If you're after some fishing gear, we're open Tuesday through Friday from one in the afternoon to seven in the evening.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.greeting1=Fishing is my game, Jakob is my name.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.greeting2=One day I will catch the elusive clownfish, I promise you!
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.greeting3=There's nothing like just sitting and waiting for a fish to bite, so relaxing.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.greeting4=I really hope it rains soon. Or is it now?
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.greeting5=I've really been wondering if I should look in to mariculture.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.greeting6=Hey if you're looking for some fishing gear, then I'm the man for you.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.greeting7=My grandpa was a great fisherman. He's what inspired me to open my own tackle shop.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.greeting8=If I spent my whole life fishing, I would be happy.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.greeting9=If you hadn't realised by now, my passion is fishing.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.greeting10=It's sure nice having some new fish to catch. It's been a life long dream.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.greeting11=Just keep swimming...
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.marriage.reject=I'm really looking for one of the other fish in the sea.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.marriage.accept=You are my starfish, I cannot wait to be your husband.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.gift.awesome=I am a huge ray fan. I could not thank you enough. Nothing can beat this.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.gift.good=All things like this are good. Thank you.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.gift.decent=Thanks for the kind gift.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.gift.dislike=I'm not so sure about this one.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.gift.bad=I really don't like what you just gave me.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.gift.terrible=Are you crazy? I would never ever want this.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.festival.chicken1=Chicken manure is a good compost. So is fish, but it smells something awful apparently.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.festival.chicken2=If you feed your chickens oyster shells, I hear it improves their eggshells. Something about... calcium.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.festival.cooking1=A good fish and chips would make this festival grand.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.festival.cooking2=Cod is a good, flaky white fish that's popular for fried fish dishes.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.festival.cow1=We need a fishing festival. I should petition for a fishing festival.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.festival.cow2=I love the rain, but the livestock hate it. I dont' have the space to keep any.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.festival.harvest1=She didn't say I had to descale the fish before adding it to the soup... or remove the bones. Or even the eyes.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.festival.harvest2=Sardines do not make a good soup. I would not try that.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.festival.new.years.eve1=Its been my dream each year to fish up a larger fish than last year. There's that Legend fish that eluded every fisherman since forever.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.festival.new.years.eve2=You should do more business with me next year. Fishing is quite a profitable business if the biting is good.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.festival.new.years1=Ever tried pickled fish inside a riceball? Or red bean paste?
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.festival.new.years2=I'm creating a poem for the new year. Would you like to hear it?
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.festival.sheep1=Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool? Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full. One for the mayor, one for the wife, and one for the little ones who live down the lane... no thats not right.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.festival.sheep2=The fishing nets you can make with quality wool ropes hold a lot of water in them.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.festival.starry.night1=There's a rare fish called the Glacierfish that you could only catch in the Cindersap Forest River Delta, I heard once. It swims upstream from the ocean to spawn only in winter.
harvestfestival.npc.jacob.festival.starry.night2=Certain fish come out only in winter.

#Pokefenn
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.greeting1=One day, I'm going to grow some vines, and you're going to climb them with me!
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.greeting2=Don't be scared of me, I may be small but I know a lot! I know all about totems.
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.greeting3=I wish my dad wasn't so scary.
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.greeting4.greeting3=Have you heard of Minecraft? It's my favourite game!
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.greeting5=Good day!
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.greeting6=Abii really scares me, have you met her?
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.greeting7=I wish my dad would let me go outside more.
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.greeting8=I want to be a herboculturistarborist a whatsit when I grow up, maybe!
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.greeting9=My favourite pokemon is bulbasaur.
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.greeting10=I love playing with the little bugs!
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.greeting11=Ohh, I remember I want to be a tree when I grow up!
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.greeting12=I want my dad to make a tree house for me.
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.gift.awesome=Woah!!!!!!! This... is... AMAZING!
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.gift.good=Thanks! I loves it!
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.gift.decent=Oo, I like it.
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.gift.dislike=Hmmm, whyy.
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.gift.bad=Whyyyy, I don't like it :(
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.gift.terrible=No, no no, no nO NOO NOOOOO!!!! This is nooo!! Just no!
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.festival.chicken1=I keep a handful of seeds in my pocket to feed the chickens in Ashlee's coop when she's not looking.
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.festival.chicken2=They follow me around in a flock when I've got the seeds in my hand. Johan's vanilla chickens love wheat seeds. So much that they start burping hearts.
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.festival.cooking1=I want to try Jade's new creation!
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.festival.cooking2=Have you tried chewing on wild mint leaves? It makes my mouth all tingly.
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.festival.cow1=Do you feed your cow by hand?
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.festival.cow2=I like feeding Jim's cows treats when I'm outside. They lick my hands, and leave me all sticky.
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.festival.harvest1=I'm hungry, when are we going to eat?
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.festival.harvest2=Its really hot when you stand next to the soup pot. I'm not allowed to add anything, dad adds it for me.
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.festival.new.years.eve1=Oh boy, I get to stay up late tonight! Dad's gonna let me!
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.festival.new.years.eve2=Will Abi get to stay up late as well? Her mom's as strict as my dad, maybe worse.
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.festival.new.years1=I stayed up late last night, and saw a shooting star! I made a wish for New Years, but I'm not telling.
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.festival.new.years2=I wonder if Abi got to stay up late. Her mum is so strict, like my dad.
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.festival.sheep1=Dad mentioned something once about a wolf in sheep's clothing. What does that mean?
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.festival.sheep2=I see the wolves outside of town lurking around the pastures. Its scary to think that wolves like to eat sheep.
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.festival.starry.night1=Is Mom coming to dinner Dad?
harvestfestival.npc.fenn.festival.starry.night2=We have to get dressed all fancy to have dinner. I wonder why?

#Jim/SpitefulFox
harvestfestival.npc.jim.shop=The Animal Ranch is open from 10am to 3pm. From Monday to Saturday.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.greeting1=What's your favourite animal? Mine's the fox, the spiteful buggers.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.greeting2=Remember you can always come see me, if you want your animals to have babies!
harvestfestival.npc.jim.greeting3=Lately I've been tweaking how much I feed my cows, it's been an educational experience.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.greeting4=You know, this world is ridiculous sometimes, just the otherday I saw a squirrel attack a bench.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.greeting5=Have you ever noticed how some countries, add 'u' to all their words, It's crazy if you ask me.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.greeting6=Life could not be better, when I'm out on the saddle.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.greeting7=Troughs can be placed up to three in a row, cows and sheep will eat from them when they're hungry if you fill them with fodder.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.greeting8=Did you know that large animals will eat your grass crops, even before you harvested them?
harvestfestival.npc.jim.greeting9=If you feed your animals treats, eventually they'll make more things for you.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.marriage.reject=I do not wish to get married.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.marriage.accept=I have wished for this day for a long time. I will one hundred percent marry you.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.gift.awesome=You are ridiculous. This is an amazing gift.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.gift.good=I don't like to be spoilt, so this is a great gift.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.gift.decent=This is a decent gift.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.gift.dislike=I can't say that I fully like this gift.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.gift.bad=This was not a good choice for a gift.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.gift.terrible=If you knew me at all, you would not dare to give me this.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.festival.chicken1=I'll just wait until the cow and sheep festivals roll around.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.festival.chicken2=That's when my animals will shine. Bessel's milk is first class.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.festival.cooking1=I sometimes go out in the pasture while doing my herd's daily grooming, and pull up any gatherable herbs I find. Jade pays well for them if they aren't stomped flat.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.festival.cooking2=Teas, salads, remedies, and just a decoration on a dish. So many uses for herbs. Flowers too, believe it or not.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.festival.cow1=You're enterin' the festival, I'm going to assume.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.festival.cow2=How's that cow doing lately? Feeding her lots of treats?
harvestfestival.npc.jim.festival.harvest1=Only the finest milk for the soup from my ranch.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.festival.harvest2=I tried to eat last year's soup with using wool for bread once. It wasn't very tasty at all. I haven't tried eating wool, or bread, since.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.festival.new.years.eve1=My new year's resolution? Mmm, I'd love to have a herd of horses to sell to players. They don't produce anything, its true, but you can get around town much faster.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.festival.new.years.eve2=Getting in touch with a leatherworker to increase my inventory for the ranch would be good. I'd love to sell saddles.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.festival.new.years1=Ah, the first day of spring. Freshly trimmed grass wakes a man up in the morning, don't you agree?
harvestfestival.npc.jim.festival.new.years2=The spring is a wonderful time to buy a miracle potion for your livestock, don't you agree %4$s?
harvestfestival.npc.jim.festival.sheep1=Sheep are very sensitive to copper, you need to only feed them the proper diet. In this case, fodder bought from me or grown in your own farm.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.festival.sheep2=Have you been feeding your sheep any treats? I hear it might do good things if you feed them lots.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.festival.starry.night1=I hope you've stocked up on fodder for the winter %4$s. Its going to be a cold one.
harvestfestival.npc.jim.festival.starry.night2=Make sure your sheep stay warm after you shear them. Its like going outside with just underwear on when they are sheared. COLD.

#Brandon/Cricket
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.shop=If you ever need some mining equipment, I'm open from Monday to Saturday, 11am to 4pm.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.greeting1=Whenever I'm down in the mines, I can't help but get excited when I come across some diamonds.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.greeting2=I don't know about you, but I've got insomnia every night, can never get to sleep... can always hear the dang crickets.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.greeting3=What's your favourite ice cream? Mine's Vanilla Plus. At least it used to be, until someone else stole it...
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.greeting4=Do you ever get tired of mining? I never do.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.greeting5=I'll never understand why people are afraid of the dark. There's nothing better than mining without seeing where you are going.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.greeting6=Remember if you ever see a dark hole, these are cracks in the surface, you can probably squeeze a ladder down them.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.greeting7=I'll let you in on a secret on how to mine more efficiently. If you jump then hit the rocks on your way down, you will smash them instantly! You'll even hit a bunch more rocks on your way down too. Oh this will also work to flatten farmland too.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.greeting8=If you're ever stuck deep down in the mine, just use an escape rope to get out.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.greeting9=If I wasn't in to mining, I'd probably chisel three rocks. Not sure why three though.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.greeting10=I got fed up of being hated in the town, now I spend all my time in the mines.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.greeting11=Be careful there's some dangerous animals in here.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.greeting12=I've seriously been considering leaving entirely, noone seems to like me.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.marriage.reject=Do you really think I would marry someone like you?
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.marriage.accept=I was hoping for someone better, but I'll marry you.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.gift.awesome=I couldn't thank you enough. I have been looking for these for ages!
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.gift.good=This stuff is always something great to receive.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.gift.decent=Thanks, that was nice.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.gift.dislike=I guess that was nice.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.gift.bad=Did you not know? I hate this stuff.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.gift.terrible=Get away from me now. How dare you insult me with such a gift.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.festival.chicken1=I swear that chicken I've seen before.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.festival.chicken2=Black feathers, red eyes, straight out of the nether-region, I tell you! Came right for me!
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.festival.cooking1=So, they're doing some sort of festival out there?
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.festival.cooking2=There isn't much worth in the outside world now. The mines are home. No crickets.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.festival.cow1=That cow is staring at me. There's a reason I'm way over here, and not over there.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.festival.cow2=I'm headed back into the mines shortly. I'm not interested in watching someone walk a cow into a stage.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.festival.harvest1=Sitting in semidarkness, watching the glints of the eyes of monsters while sipping my thermos of nice hot soup. Nothing better.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.festival.harvest2=Pickaxes don't serve as good soup spoons apparently. I've got the burns to prove it.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.festival.new.years.eve1=There isn't a big difference between this year, and the next. You just get older. The mines get older too.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.festival.new.years.eve2=The rocks grow older and grow crystals eventually. Open up to reveal more ore... thats what I want to see. More ores. Diamonds. Emeralds. Avoiding monsters and such.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.festival.new.years1=High ho, high ho, its off to mine I go... Hm? Oh hello.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.festival.new.years2=Spring isn't as profitable for finding ore below ground than winter is, have you noticed? Copper seems quite findable at last, junk as it is.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.festival.sheep1=The shape of a sheep's eyeball makes me uneasy. Its so... flat.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.festival.sheep2=Like they've got no soul inside. Or are seeking to eat me in the depths of the mine.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.festival.starry.night1=A mining I shall go, a mining I shall go. Ores and rocks and cherry booms, a mining I shall go.
harvestfestival.npc.brandon.festival.starry.night2=If someone actually cared, they can bring me leftovers in the mines. Hint hint.

#Tomas
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.greeting1=I will save you from your sins.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.greeting2=Remember if you ever need any cursed tools, blessed I will be happy to help.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.greeting3=Only he can save you now.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.greeting4=The lord's grace, is shining down upon you.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.greeting7=May god have mercy on you.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.greeting8=I believe I can fly.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.greeting9=Why did I ever marry that witch, katlin.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.greeting10=You should see the church on Sundays. It is quite packed.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.greeting11=I am so proud of Abii, my little girl. I think Cloe has a lot to learn from her.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.greeting12=The power of christ compels you!
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.gift.awesome=What an explosive gift! This is just perfect. God loves you, child.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.gift.good=This is such a heavenly gift, thank you.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.gift.decent=Bless you my child.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.gift.dislike=This is, err, okay.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.gift.bad=You insult god with your gift!
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.gift.terrible=I would condemn you to hell for such a gift, it is just not right.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.festival.chicken1=Don't bring your chickens near Jaimii, she hates animals. Sleeps with earmuffs to avoid the crow of the rooster.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.festival.chicken2=Birds are able to reach the sky, something we cannot do without help. Chickens don't fly much though. Do they prefer the faith of the ground?
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.festival.cooking1=For the next Sunday sermon, I shall present bread and grape juice on the altar.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.festival.cooking2=The more crackerlike the bread, the better.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.festival.cow1=I can bless your tools, but not your animals for a win.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.festival.cow2=A fine day for a festival. He is smiling upon this day.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.festival.harvest1=A tithe for the harvest to seal the deal for bountiful autumn?
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.festival.harvest2=Pray that our veg grows big and strong.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.festival.new.years.eve1=A blessing for the new year to you, %4$s.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.festival.new.years.eve2=A tithe to the church is always appreciated. Our bell needs a new can of polish.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.festival.new.years1=May your soul be purified for the next year.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.festival.new.years2=Do not forget to make your tithe to the church.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.festival.sheep1=Sheep bring the wolf. The wolf is a bad omen. Carry silver on the full moon.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.festival.sheep2=Remember, I can bless your tools, but not your animals.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.festival.starry.night1=Jaimii is my dinner date, %4$s. I am unlikely to choose another.
harvestfestival.npc.thomas.festival.starry.night2=When dinner is complete, some couples come to pray at the church before retiring.

#Candice
harvestfestival.npc.candice.greeting1=I love my job, and sharing it with my friends.
harvestfestival.npc.candice.greeting2=Some people can just be real moos!

harvestfestival.npc.candice.greeting7=Did you know that I normally work with Jim as a milkmaid?.

harvestfestival.npc.candice.festival.chicken1=Why are you talking to me? Ashlee is the one to speak to about chickens!
harvestfestival.npc.candice.festival.chicken2=Milk. Maid. Not chicken maid. Sheesh.
harvestfestival.npc.candice.festival.cooking1=Yes, I KNOW milk is used in cooking, but don't you hate the smell while heating it?
harvestfestival.npc.candice.festival.cooking2=The ranch should still be open for business while this stupid festival is going on, at least then I have an excuse to skip this.
harvestfestival.npc.candice.festival.cow1=Nothing better than fresh milk straight from the cow.
harvestfestival.npc.candice.festival.cow2=Butter, cheese, cream, ice cream, so many uses for milk.

#Yulife
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.shop=If yer looking for buildings, I'm afraid I'm only available 9am to 5:30pm, Sunday to Friday.
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.greeting1=Building stuff is so time consuming, when will I get a break?
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.greeting2=People treat me like a slave, no rest for the builder!
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.greeting3=Have you seen Jim? Isn't he just?
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.greeting4=I am tired of all this hard work, When will ya appreciate my buildings?
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.greeting5=I am tired of wandering around, I am dying right now.
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.greeting6=If ya get in my way, I can't build there.
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.greeting7=After many complaints that my wood and stone prices were crazy I've decided to reduce the price.
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.greeting8=How have yer been getting on %4$s?
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.greeting9=If you ever lose me, remember yer can always recall me with a new carpenter building.
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.greeting10=I'll have more building for ya as our town grows.
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.greeting11=If ya need to know when someone's open for business, just ask.

harvestfestival.npc.yulif.gift.bad=Err, what? Why would I ever want this?
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.gift.terrible=Damn, is this really what ya think I would like? Please don't talk to me.
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.festival.chicken1=Animals are so pushy, and smelly. They keep knocking all the torches out of the barns and coops.
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.festival.chicken2=If you didn't need the products to cook with, I wouldn't bother with working with animals myself.
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.festival.cooking1=Depending on who enters the cooking festival, there's really good pastries to try.
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.festival.cooking2=I do wish melons came into season sooner, a nice crisp melon salad or something... perhaps with mint... Hmm.
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.festival.cow1=This is Jim's favorite festival. I'm not so interested.
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.festival.cow2=The animal ranch needs a new blueprint, but Jim's so busy I haven't had the chance to show him any new ideas. He's always with his livestock.
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.festival.harvest1=Don't talk to me. Talk to my sister if you want to add food to the pot.
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.festival.harvest2=Jade yelled at me when I put melon slices into the pot one year. The rinds ruined the soup. Oh well, more melon for me. -chomp-
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.festival.new.years.eve1=My new year's resolution is to create a fantastic new blueprint for the animal ranch.
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.festival.new.years.eve2=When you cut down a tree in the forest in winter, who is around to hear it fall?
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.festival.new.years1=Mm, Happy New Year, I ‘spose. *Sigh*
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.festival.new.years2=Long life, wealth and happiness. From a riceball. Mm. Do you believe those things?
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.festival.sheep1=If you spin wool thick enough, you can make ropes out of it. Sheep do have a use after all.
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.festival.sheep2=They appear to be pickier about what they eat than cows do, by what I see Jim's flock do. They never eat mint, but cows do.
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.festival.starry.night1=Its so quiet when building in the winter. Just the sound of construction when everything else is silent.
harvestfestival.npc.yulif.festival.starry.night2=We're having a get together to celebrate the winter season. Its not much, but its tradition. Its also tradition to invite someone to dinner.

#Ashlee
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.shop=If you ever need anything, just be sure to ask. But only from 6am to 12pm, Monday through Saturday.
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.greeting1=I sure love plucking chickens!
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.greeting2=I am so tired, working with chickens is such hard work!
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.greeting3=From this day forward, I hope I can sleep better.
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.greeting4=Most chicken handlers hate foxes, I love them. They're so furry, like me!
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.greeting5=Cluck, Cluck, Cluck Clucking. When will these chicks just shut the Cluck up!
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.greeting6=Feeding your chickens by hand will make you love them more, but it is more work.
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.greeting7=Chickens are happy to eat treats and chicken treats.
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.greeting8=The boys used to tease me at school, but looking at me now, surrounded by chicks!
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.greeting9=Incubators may be expensive but they're a great return on investment.
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.greeting10=The more treats you give an animal, the more they'll produce for you each day.
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.greeting11=Make sure to keep your chickens close to their nests, they won't wander far for them.
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.marriage.reject=Why would you even consider proposing?
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.marriage.accept=Woah, you are the best fox ever, I will marry you.
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.gift.awesome=You are a top fox, I love it with all my furry heart!
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.gift.good=This fox is happy to receive this.
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.gift.decent=Nice gift!
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.gift.dislike=Please don't give me this.
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.gift.bad=Why would you ever give me this?
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.gift.terrible=This gift is the worst thing I have ever received.
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.festival.chicken1=Are you entering the Chicken Festival?! I need some competition!
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.festival.chicken2=Is it strange for foxes like me to enjoy chickens this much without eating them?
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.festival.cooking1=Don't ever eat raw eggs. I hear that some people will give their dogs and cats raw egg for coat improvements. Can that work for tamed wolves or foxes too? Maybe I should try raw egg for improving my hair...
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.festival.cooking2=A splash of oil works well when learning how to make a fried egg. Add the oil before you start heating the frying pan though, hot oil is a painful burn.
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.festival.cow1=I just don't like cows. They're too big.
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.festival.cow2=I bet the mayor's getting a kick of having all the cows messing up the festival grounds.
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.festival.harvest1=Boiled egg, scrambled egg, poached egg, raw egg, fried egg... oh so many choices to add to the soup.
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.festival.harvest2=Or I'll just throw in a freshly plucked chicken!
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.festival.new.years.eve1=I'm looking forward to doing some work with Yulif possibly to draft a chicken coop in the next year. My girls are a bit cramped in my barn, they could do with some free range space outside.
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.festival.new.years.eve2=Its not really a resolution, but on my to-do list. And get more fox stuff!
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.festival.new.years1=A furry scarf for a new year! Fox fur is so soft.
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.festival.new.years2=If my chicks didn't need so much care during the winter, I would've hibernated like any other fox.
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.festival.sheep1=I've got this itch to start chasing sheep all of a sudden. Its it because foxes like to chase sheep?
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.festival.sheep2=I've watched sheep herding trials before; its amazing what the shepherds and their dogs can do.
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.festival.starry.night1=There you go my chickies, nice and cozy warm in your nests...
harvestfestival.npc.ashlee.festival.starry.night2=You inviting anyone to the winter dinner?

#Girafi

harvestfestival.npc.girafi.greeting2=Good day sir, I've been planning my next trip for a while, and I'm thinking I'll head to Denmark.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.greeting3=It's most wonderful to see you again!
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.greeting4=I could talk all day about my adventures out in the world, did I tell you about this one time that I strangled a squid and...
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.greeting5=Hallo, hoe goes it?
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.greeting6=Oh my, it's such a pleasure to see you once more.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.greeting7=Everyone has good days and bad days, you've just made my day great.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.greeting8=I am willing to trade for eggs, milk or wool, do not forget!
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.greeting9=I have explored many biomes, in fact plenty of them indeed!
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.greeting10=I could not be happier right now.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.marriage.reject=It has been a pleasure to know you. But I do not feel that way about you.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.marriage.accept=This is just wonderful, I will gladly marry you, and whisk you away somewhere far.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.gift.awesome=My, you absolutely know how to please a gentlemans senses. I can not thank you deeply enough.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.gift.good=You are a wonderful human being, thank you.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.gift.decent=This gift is good.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.gift.dislike=I am sorry, but this does not feel good.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.gift.bad=This gift is not something I would ever buy for myself.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.gift.terrible=This is possibly the last thing on earth I would ever consider owning. Do you hate me?
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.festival.chicken1=I do have vanilla eggs, yes. Are you looking for a trade? Come find me after the festival.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.festival.chicken2=I warn you, I'm not a chicken person, so if your vanilla eggs are infertile, don't get angry at me.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.festival.cooking1=I travelled to a country called India once, and tried a fried wrapped potato called a samosa once. It was quite spicy, but potatoes are decent whatever you do to them.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.festival.cooking2=Have you tried potatoes on a stick to roast them with herbs? I tried to roast a potato on a spit once... but it shrivelled before I could eat it. I guess you can only roast pigs or larger meats.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.festival.cow1=A bottle for a bucket, life of a trader of milk. Its a decent trade, yes?
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.festival.cow2=Like horses, one never stands right behind a cow. I like not having a hoofprint bruise on my gut, thank you.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.festival.harvest1=We celebrate the harvest in order to please our Goddess that we have a bountiful autumn each year. So far, we've done so-so, I'd say.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.festival.harvest2=I am more of a stew sort than a soup sort. Much richer, and good for warming from inside out.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.festival.new.years.eve1=I resolve to go back to Denmark next year. If not for a few weeks. See the family and such.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.festival.new.years.eve2=Noodles. What a strange choice of food. They look like pale snakes in a bowl. Just waiting to rear up and strike as you go at them with a fork or sticks.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.festival.new.years1=Godt nytår!
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.festival.new.years2=This riceball is sticky, and keeps breaking apart when I take a bite.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.festival.sheep1=I've still got some vanilla wool if you're willing to trade those lumps of wool to me.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.festival.sheep2=This sweater is a bit itchy. Straight wool yarn makes me itchy.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.festival.starry.night1=If I got invited to dinner, I'd invite Jenni and Candice. Its a family event, sort of. And since I live here... yeah.
harvestfestival.npc.girafi.festival.starry.night2=In Denmark in the winter, you rarely see the sun. Its almost always cloudy, and the sun sets really quickly.

harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.intro.backstory=Well then, nice to meet you. I am the Harvest Goddess. I'd like to tell you a little story. A long time ago, this land we live in was filled with a bustling village, the people there were removed from their homes by a crazy storm, and wiped out, now I hear that they want to return back home where they belong, but they need your help. Oh and just to let you know, I will poof after a while, you can always respawn me with the goddess flower. I'll leave you one everytime I leave.

I've heard rumours that a fella named Yulif is an excellent carpenter, he and his sister have been looking to take on a project, and this could just be the right thing for them. Jade would be a perfect fit too as she loves nature and would be a great asset for getting started.

If Yulif hasn't moved in yet he'll appear and get started working on the building right away! You'll just have to wait a little while for him to be done. Take note you can queue up blueprints, but only one can be built at a time. Oh and don't worry if he dies from some tragic accident! He should respawn when the day passes over and get back to work immediately! I think that's all I have to say, so I'll leave you to get the Carpenter House built. Oh one more thing before I forget, once he's done building Jade should move in, she normally hangs out upstairs, I'd suggest that you go and take her a flower, as she has seeds she'll be happy to trade for them.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.carpenter.reminder.carpenter=Sweety you're supposed to be going to see Jade not me! If you haven't yet get a Carpenter House built and visit her upstairs with a flower. If you're in trouble and lost the blueprint, just bring me another %s logs and I'll give you another one.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.carpenter.reminder.give=Thanks have another blueprint and go see Jade!
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.carpenter.reminder.flowers=Nice to meet you, I'm Jade. I'm kinda uhhh looking for a flower right now.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.carpenter.thanks.flowers=Hey! Looks like you have a flower for me! The goddess told me all about you, I can't wait to see the town grow. I think the goddess wants to thank you for helping us out, so you should go see her. But afterwards please do come back and visit me as I have something I'd love to show you!
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.carpenter.thanks.finish=Well done dear, this town will be built in no time with you at the helm. Getting things done will probably cost you some money though, so I'm happy to give you a starting gift of 1000 gold. I hope you spend it wisely, anyway, you should be off to see Jade again now! Thanks for the help.

#Crops Tutorial
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.crops.title=Crop Farming
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.crops.title.what=Mystery Gift?
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.crops.description.jade=Talk to Jade.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.crops.description.turnips=Grow nine Hardy Turnips.\nShow them to Jade.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.crops.intro=Hey! As promised I have something to tell you about! Crop Farming. Has anyone ever taught you before?
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.crops.question=Do you know how to farm crops?
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.crops.tutorial=@How do I farm crops?
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.crops.skip=@I know how
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.crops.completed=Well then if you know everything, please just take these items to get started.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.crops.start=Well then let me teach you! The very basics of crop farming is that you need to till some ground, once done, simply plant some seeds in this spot. Keep in mind that seeds plant in a 3x3 area. You'll need to make sure those seeds watered every day, or they will not grow, as well as making sure you have the correct crops for that season. In order to use your hoe, you simply have to right click it to till dirt in to farmland. Before you can use the watering can however you will need to fill it with water. Take these and come back to me when you have grown yourself nine hardy turnips. Oh, one final tip, if you want to speed up crop growth, you can sleep. Crops will grow everyday, so this is the quickest way to get them to grow!
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.crops.reminder.turnips=Hey again. Looks like you don't have nine hardy turnips yet. If you're stuck and lost your hoe, just come back to me with a stone hoe and I'll happily trade. If you need another watering can, I can spare some for buckets. Oh and if you want one bag of hardy turnips just bring me five flowers.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.crops.thanks.flowers=Oh my so pretty, thanks! Here take these hardy turnip seeds seeds as a thank you.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.crops.thanks.hoe=Perfect, here's my hoe.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.crops.thanks.bucket=Just what I'm after, you can have one of my spare watering cans.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.crops.complete=Wow you have done a fantastic job growing these hardy turnips, I am tempted to take them for myself. But you can keep them. I don't want you to have wasted your time on me. I should probably tell you, that you can sell whatever you grow for gold. You'll just need a shipping bin. If you want them you can buy them directly from my brother's shop, when he's open for business. To use them, all you have to do is right click with the item held in your hand, and they should be ready to be shipped. In the morning you'll get gold for everything you ship. If you don't want to ship everything by hand, just place a hopper next to the bin and it will happily insert. Profits go to whoever placed it! Just to let you know though, the turnips you've been growing aren't really worth much. You'll need to grow some others, which you can get from me, if you want to make more money. I do have a small supply but I'm happy to trade for five flowers at any time. I would suggest though that you talk to my brother and get the general store built as soon as possible. The people there should be able to sell you much more variety than I could ever! As a last reward, take this sickle. You'll need it to harvest some crops, and it is pretty effective at destroying dead ones!

#Chicken Care
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.chicken.title=Foxie's Fowls
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.chicken.description.talk=Talk to Ashlee.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.chicken.description.build=Build the Poultry Farm.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.chicken.description.throw=Throw and feed a chicken.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.chicken.description.egg=Show Ashlee a small egg.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.chicken.reminder.talk=Sweety it looks you've had a Poultry Farm built. You should go and talk to Ashlee.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.chicken.reminder.poultry=Hey my dear, don't forget you're going to want a Poultry Farm.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.chicken.start=I love this place. Isn't it wonderful, Mr Fox? I hope I get to stay here for longer. Oh, hello! Sorry I didn't see you there, I was just ehhh. Nevermind. Anyway, welcome to my Poultry Farm! My name is Ashlee.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.chicken.question=Do you know how to take care of chickens?
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.chicken.tutorial=@Show me please!
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.chicken.skip=@Give me the goods!
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.chicken.completed=Oh well then, that's good. Please take this spare chicken and somethings to help.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.chicken.throw=Ahh so you don't know? Well then first things first, you must feed your chickens! If you don't, they will get sick and stop producing anything for you! You can feed chickens by hand or with a feeding tray. Chickens, like us need a bit of love too. To show a chicken that you love it, just make sure to pick it up every day. You can pick up chickens by right clicking them, they love it! Just right click the ground again to throw them back down. Feeding by hand also makes a chicken love you a bit more. A happier chicken will produce bigger and better eggs. Here's some feed. Can you go feed this chicken and show it some additional love? Then come back to me.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.chicken.reminder.throw=Remember? I asked you to pick up a chicken, and feed it some chicken feed.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.chicken.egg=Well done. It looks like you now know how to take care of your chickens. As mentioned before, happier chickens make bigger eggs. But how do I get eggs you ask? Well my dear simply place a nest box nearby. And eventually the chicken will lay an egg. They'll only lay one egg a day however. They won't lay eggs unless they have been fed. Once you collected your eggs, don't forget to ship them off for some gold. I have a nest box for you, come back and see me when you've got an egg from your chicken.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.chicken.reminder.egg=Remember I'm after an egg from a chicken. If you need a new box, you can buy one from me.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.chicken.complete=For your hard work, I'm happy to give you a rare egg! If you want to get more you'll really have to take care of your chickens. Oh right, there's also somethings else you may not know about yet, first thing, take your chickens inside when it's going to rain, and bring them out when it's sunny, also something else is the incubator. With an incubator you can hatch your own chickens. You just need to place an egg inside, wait a few days and then a chick should hatch! They'll be born with half the relationship so it's much better than just buying more. By the way, thanks for letting me open shop here.

#Cow Care

harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.cow.start=I'm quite glad that you've invited me here. I'm Jim by the way, I run the Animal Ranch. As a thanks, I have a spare cow for you.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.cow.question=Do you know how to take care of cows?
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.cow.tutorial=@Give me instructions
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.cow.skip=@I already know
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.cow.completed=Is that so? Well here she is. Take these to help you out too.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.cow.info=Is that so? Guess I better teach you then. The basics are easy, these bigger animals like to be fed and loved, but they also need to be kept clean if you want them to stay healthy. They like to be fed fodder, which you can feed them by hand for a bonus, or with a trough. To show your cows some love just talk to them to by holding right click on them, until they show you the love back. Do the same when brushing them, but this time with a brush in hand, to get them squeaky clean. Go and give that a go, feed the cow and give her a clean.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.cow.reminder.talk=Remember I advised you to go and feed your cow by hand as well as brushing them.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.cow.milk=Well done, looks like you know how to keep your cows happy. Cows will make you milk every day. To get milk you'll need to take a milker to them and hold right click until you get what you desire. Remember the friendlier you are with your animals the bigger products they'll give you. Go and bring me some milk from your cow.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.cow.reminder.milk=Did you forget? I asked you to go and milk your cow.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.cow.complete=You've done a fine job there. I have some additional advice. For one your animals like to be outside when it's sunny and inside when it's rainy. And also to breed your animals just buy a Miracle Potion from me. It'll impregnate your animals, and after a few days they'll give birth to a baby, who'll have half the relationship points of the parent. That's all for now. Please do come again.

harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.cafe.question=Do you need to learn how to cook?
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.cafe.tutorial=@I do indeed
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.cafe.skip=@I can work it out
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.cafe.completed=Well that's just awesome! I'm happy to give you these things to get started though.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.cafe.explain=Well that's just awesome! I'm happy to teach you. To get started you are going to need some sort of utensil. The most basic one would be the kitchen counter in combo with a knife. You'll also need to know how to prepare a recipe. You can buy a bunch from me, but here's Pickled Turnip to start with. You'll just have to add it to your knowledge with right click. To see it, just grab yourself a Recipe Book. Select the utensil and then the recipe. You'll then be able to see a list of items on the right hand side that you will need. If you have the ingredients and the utensil in place, clicking cook will place all the ingredients in to the utensil. It should then start cooking. Unless you're using a counter of course! Then you'll need to chop with a right click instead. If you need additional cookware, I'm happy to sell them to you, but they're only available at weekends. One last thing. The recipes in the book are the very basics, you should try experimenting with adding extra ingredients, and you might be able to make a better version. Thanks for your time.

harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.mining.explain=Well I should probably explain then if I must. I would explain it but all you have to do is to break the nodes you see hanging around the mine with a hammer. Although there are different kind of nodes such as copper or just plain rocks. I've had this old hammer of mine for a long time now, and it's just become a bit useless, I think you should have it. Prove to me that you can mine then I'll let you keep it. Go smash some plain rocks and bring me back three junk ore.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.mining.complete=Ehhh, I guess that's a decent job you did there. I've got some more to give you but at least you understand the basics now. Should warn you that there are some rocks that are too strong for this hammer. You'll need better ones for that. I believe a Blacksmith could help you out with that. You may also find some blocked holes down in the mines. You can fill these holes with ladders from my store. That way you can travel down deeper.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.mining.reminder=Just bring me three junk ore, to prove to me that you know how mining works.
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.mining.question=Got a clue about nodes and mining?
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.mining.tutorial=@Please help me!
harvestfestival.quest.tutorial.mining.skip=@HAMMER TIME pls
