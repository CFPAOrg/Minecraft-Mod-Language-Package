#Researchs
research_name.thaumicbases:tbases=A New Chapter
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbases.1=Opening this segment of the Thaumonomicon, I am bewildered to see pages that I can't see. The strange part of it is, is that I can see this simple part of the chapter. Perhaps looking more into §lBasic§r parts of this chapter will aide me in revealing the knowledge hiding within these pages.
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbases.2=There we are! Upon sifting through some of my notes whilst searching for Basic research, my mind opened up to learning more about this unusual art. Now that I can read some more of the pages, I believe it's time to look a little further. 

research_name.thaumicbases:alc=Basic Alchemy
research_stage.thaumicbases:alc.1=Something feels wrong... maybe my tests with Alchemical Metallurgy was but a fluke. From my research of creating Thaumium, it feels rather dull in terms of power. Something tells me that I could make this more powerful, but how could I do so? Perhaps these "fragments" could help me, maybe?
research_stage.thaumicbases:alc.2=While the fragments were useless to me in my search for a stronger metal, I was able to pinpoint a use for them in a different page. Nonetheless, I have finally made something more powerful than Thaumium! I can't really think of a good name, so I will call it Thauminite. This metal should be a lot sturdier than Diamond as well as having much more potency in enchanting, and the armor I can make out of it gives me a Vis Discount! However... I can't seem to find many more uses for it outside of tools, if I was really desperate for a better option. Perhaps I should look more into what the properties of the tools I can create from this could be.

research_name.thaumicbases:pyrof=Liquid Blaze
research_stage.thaumicbases:pyrof.1=Fluids are not often researched within the arts of miracle-working, however... this page seems to be hinting at something called "Pyrofluid". While it sounds rather silly, it may house some incredible use! Perhaps studying the fluids that I already know could help me understand this more.
research_stage.thaumicbases:pyrof.2=Voilà! After breaking my back and brain to create this fluid, I deem my work of massacring Blazes to be concluded. No more Spawner camping, no more turning into KFT. Upon placing this fluid down, I found several things. Firstly, it burns. Do not come into contact with this fluid. I miss having a foot. Secondly, the fluid appears to crystallize slowly over time. However... I had been foolish enough to slip on one of my notes, tossing the bucket of fluid into my Arcane Spa, retriving it shows something rather pleasant! While I lost a small portion of the mind-cleansing fluid in my spa, I did get a solidified version of Pyrofluid. Breaking it with my pickaxe results in a generous handful of Blaze Powder. It does not appear to work with the Fortune Enchantment.

research_name.thaumicbases:sweed=Sweed
research_stage.thaumicbases:sweed.1=Sugar Cane can be a chore to grow, even at it's most efficient. Finding a way to grow it faster is nothing but a headache that I don't need along with the several others I experience. Studying the growth of plants might be a topic I should research whilst making my roundabouts with my Golems. I do dearly enjoy watching them work.
research_stage.thaumicbases:sweed.2=With the success of plant growth research, I am able to announce that I've managed to make a magical plant with Thaumaturgy! The running name I have for it currently is "Sweed", however, I may come up with a better name in future times. Sweed is a very interesting crop, as it acts as a "weed with a sweet deal to it". What this means is that it infests a grassy area around it, growing and repopulating very quickly. It's best to be careful that I don't place this seed down in an open grassy area as it'll kill the plantlife in that area very quickly, but keeping it contained is an incredible benefit to have. This crop will normally yield around 1-3 handfuls of sugar per crop yield with the occasional chance of being able to uproot a handful of Sugar Cane reeds. Not perfect, but with a good setup, I could likely make it more efficient than even the best of sugar cane farms! While not currently working as intended, it appears to make some interesting patterns, and if you're lucky, maybe it'll be in the shape of a heart!

research_name.thaumicbases:plant=Further Herbology
research_stage.thaumicbases:plant.1=I feel as if there's more of a diligant nature to these handfuls of seeds that I hold in my hand. Perhaps I should study more than just seeds, I should study flowers, I should study some of the crops that I grow. There's gotta be something that I can do!
research_stage.thaumicbases:plant.2=After an exhausting night of studying flowers and some of my crops, I've managed to create a few, hopefully very useful, plants. With these designs, I should be able to get much use from these new crop plants I've conceptualized.<PAGE>§7§l§nPlax Seeds§r - My idea for the Plax Seeds was that I could get a handful of string from this crop, and get a seed from it... however, I got roughly §n6-11§r strands of string and about §n1-4§r seeds. What a delight! Something actually better happening than what I expect it to be! However it does appear to yield nothing at times.<PAGE>§a§l§nRosa Mysteria§r - The Rosa Mysteria is an interesting plant that I've created thus far, once I made the seed it seemed to reject the soil I planted it on, withering away near instantly. I tried it with Salis Mundus under it similarly to the Lucrite plant, and it showed the same results. I tried it on Salis Mundus, and it still was far too weak to grow anything of use. All hope seemed lost until I had concocted the idea of the rooting it into the Crystal Blocks I had made. They similarly stabilize my Infusion Altar, so why wouldn't they be able to stabilize the Rosa Mysteria? After having had tested it out, the Rosa Mysteria began to grow rather delightfully! The Rosa Mysteria, depending on which block you place it on, will drop differing things, a big example being that the Rosa Mysteria will give me Ignis Vis Crystals upon harvesting the plant under a Fire Crystal Block, the other Crystal Blocks will drop their respective Vis Crystals as well, however not the Mixed Crystal Block. The Mixed Crystal Block will increase my yield of these strange paper tatters, why I would want them is unbenounced to me, but they do provide an excellent experience yield when I crush them in my hands.<PAGE>§d§l§nAurelia§r - This plant has proven extreme use and worth of my time! Originally, the idea was for the plant to shed petals that would allow me to make use of Aurum Essentia, since it's so god damn annoying to get. However, after some renditions of failed flowers, I finally had one that conveniently worked during the Night.<PAGE>§4§l§nRedlon Seed§r - This one is working as it should, my plan was to make an, essentially, regrowable source of redstone similar to how my Melons and Pumpkins grew, and with the recent development of this "Redlon" (which is just a block of Redstone Dust). It turned out to be an incredible success! This might be it, this might be my turning point!<PAGE>§8§l§nMetalleat Seed§r - Much like the Plax Seeds, however it drops Iron Nuggets instead. Iron Nuggets are a lot more managable for a plant to grow than a full ingot of iron. The yield is roughly §n6-9§r Iron Nuggets per crop harvest and about §n1-3§r seeds per crop harvest.<PAGE>§1§l§nLazullia Seed§r - This plant is also similar in concept to the Plax Seeds, however, I get Lapis Lazuli gems instead of string, quite handy for Enchanting and Sensus Essentia! This plant yields roughly §n0-3§r Lapis Lazuli gems per yield and §n0-2§r Lazullia Seeds per yield.<PAGE>§2§l§nGlieona Seed§r - This one works vastly better than my previous iterations of the seed. This crop yields me roughly §n3-12§r Glowstone Dust upon its growth and §n0-2§r Glieonia Seeds. One thing to note, however is that this plant will only work when grown on Grass.<PAGE>§c§l§nLucrite Seeds§r - Similar to the Plax seeds... however, instead of string, it grows roughly §n3-9§r Golden Nuggets per harvest yield, along with a bonus of a Golden Carrot, how splendid! One thing that I noted while trying it out is that it refuses to grow when I placed it on farmland, I have to have it under a Salis Mundus Block, in order for it to work.<PAGE>§a§l§nBriar Flowerbush§r - This is similar to a berry bush. It grows unusual podling flowers that don't seem to allow it to reproduce though... which is odd for a name like "Briar Seedpod", however... this leads me to the creation of a very delicious syrup that I'm dubbing §c§nRosehip Syrup§r! This syrup acts similarly to milk, and removes any and all effects. However, its benefit is that I can keep all of my good buffs with me! No more having to sacrifice potion ingredients because of my incompetence at cures. This is the cure-all!<PAGE>§2§l§nTobacco Seed§r - This is more thoroughly explained in the "Now Where is my Pipe?" section that I wrote in a different page of the Thaumonomicon. Upon it's yield, it produces roughly §n1-2§r usable Tobacco Leaves and §n0-2§r Tobacco Seeds.<PAGE>§l§n§cP§r§l§n§6r§r§l§n§ei§a§l§nm§r§9§l§na§r§5§l§nl§r §l§n§7Shroom§r - At first this strange fungus had shown no signs of seeming to do anything, until I had looked at my Thaumometer's Vis Meter. I can now say that this Primal Fungus releases §n5-15§r vis matter into the air! Very useful for Thaumaturge's who need a quick pinch of vis to craft with!

research_name.thaumicbases:tobacco=Now Where Could My Pipe Be?
research_stage.thaumicbases:tobacco.1=Drug use is bad, if someone somehow finds this book and decides to take a look at it, I hope they know that I do not condone the use of drugs, especially tobacco products and hard drugs. However... I can't seem to find a good way to relax, I'm getting desperate. While drugs normally do not exist outside of the Vishroom, it doesn't really let me relax. I need something to soothe my aching and anxious mind. I really hoped I wouldn't have to go to bad habits and possible addiction.
research_stage.thaumicbases:tobacco.2=§l§nMortar and Pestle§r - I have carved out a sturdier bowl for tobacco crushing. Yet I also could swear that I've crushed something else with this before. Maybe flowers?<PAGE>§l§nSmoking Pipes§r - I have created two types of pipes from the research I've made, and as much as I don't want to use them. I can't stop myself now, I'm too stressed.<BR>The §o§nGreatwood Puffpipe§r should allow me to take quick puffs of tobacco to soothe my head, unfortunately it isn't the best at using the tobacco I created to its fullest extent, smoking using this pipe will still have the downsides of typical tobacco in general. The §o§nSilverwood Puffpipe§r, however, negates most of the negative effects of the Tobaccos without sacrificing my lungs! Not only will the tobaccos have a stronger positive effect on me, they will last a while longer too.<PAGE>§l§nTobacco Piles§r - I've created an assortment of 9 different tobaccos, each with special effects that will need to be addressed, I need to make sure I don't mix these up.<BR>The §5§o§nVoidseer's Tobacco§r allows me to give my enemies a whole new meaning of "If looks could kill", the Deadly Gaze I should've received from the tobacco strengthens my gaze to wither my enemies away, I best be careful to not look at my allies after I've smoked this.<BR>The §4§o§nBerserker Tobacco§r allows my muscles to become more viable in combat, letting me shred through my opponents with a clean sweep of a sword slash. I feel as if I could slay a thousand.<BR>The §c§o§nNourishing Tobacco§r allows me to satiate my hunger, and prolong the time it takes before I need to eat again... that doesn't sound very healthy now that I'm thinking about it, but it will allow me to focus more on my research... and possibly bake brownies with this.<BR>The §7§o§nEnlightened Tobacco§r allows me to have revelations beyond my imagination, giving me random research that I could use in future endeavors. Something whispers in my ears as the smoke of this tobacco clears however...<BR>The §8§o§nGeologist Tobacco§r allows me to break the earth a lot faster, especially with a pickaxe! I surely hope this is not what they mean by "miner's lung"<BR>The §b§o§nPrudent Tobacco§r allows me to be rid of some of the dwindling madness that stirs within my head. Maybe... maybe for once I'll be able to sleep well without something haunting my dreams.<BR>The §5§o§nFetid Tobacco§r is the most dubious of the Tobaccos I've made thus far, giving me temporary warp from smoking it, why I would need it seems unfeasible, but I am a madman, I may come up with a use for it. A side note to put down as well, the Silverwood Puffpipe does not survive from the use of this wretched tobacco, however seemingly negates it in its entirity.<BR>The §3§o§nWispy Tobacco§r, oddly, spawns a Wisp upon its use. Why I would use this is also a similar question to the Fetid Tobacco, why I would want Wisps in my vicinity is a surefire question.<BR>Maybe now I won't have to waste so much Purifying Fluid, unfortunately that doesn't mitigate my sudden urge to make baked goods with this Tobacco put into it as well.

research_name.thaumicbases:voidseeds=Growing Darkness
research_stage.thaumicbases:voidseeds.1=Void Metal, an impressively valuable asset to my arsenal since I also have a lack of common sense when it comes to these Rifts that have been appearing around my base. Although it's due to my mistakes, I have no one to blame but myself. However, my mistakes could be the big reason I become more powerful. As a Thaumaturge, one of the things I've learned from my experiences is "Knowledge is Power", and it's taken quite the literal way too! So whether mistakes are made, or I become superiorly intelligent from my successes, I think I've hatched an idea. These §lVoid Seeds§r might be the key to growing my own darkness without having to pollute the aura.
research_stage.thaumicbases:voidseeds.2=Thanks to my ingenius observation with plant matter, I have created a catalyst of a plant seed that should produce a few Void Seeds from its complete growth, and thankfully no side effects should come from it as well! Let's just hope I can manage further without many more mistakes. 

research_name.thaumicbases:raincac=Rainbow Cactus
research_stage.thaumicbases:raincac.1=Cacti are almost conceptually useless in practical theory. They poke you, destroy items are dropped from monsters. These little buggers are not good for a thaumaturge such as myself, I don't need my robes getting caught in its thorns! So how about I give a Cactus more purpose than being just the ugliest thing in the world?
research_stage.thaumicbases:raincac.2=Well, I couldn't fix the ugly part, in fact I think I made it worse... However, I have been able to negate its other two downsides! The Rainbow Cactus is a plant that allows me to grow my own dyes, and with that comes uses of its own! Breaking a cactus block that grown above the cacti I placed down on sand grants me a plentiful handful of dyes, however, it will not yield items like Cocoa Beans, Lapis Lazuli, Ink Sacs, and Bonemeal. This cactus appears to grow very slowly in comparison to regular cactus however. Likely due to needing more nutrients in order to grow.

research_name.thaumicbases:goldtree=Garden of Golden Fruit
research_stage.thaumicbases:goldtree.1=I've heard of a way to make an apple tree work for me in a far better way. Sure, Apples are quite a nice snack, but what other healing benefits do I get out of it than the sweetness of a freshly picked fruit? I've come up with a theory in which I can make a tree that exclusively grows Golden Apples. Though, I will have plan out how this goes about, considering these apples may be too heavy for weak tree branches to handle.
research_stage.thaumicbases:goldtree.2=After having had thought of such a thing, I have made a Golden Tree in which any and all apples that fall from the golden branches will be Golden, and delicious! While I am unable to get the Legendary "Enchanted Golden Apple", these will have to do for right now. I'm sure there's a way that I can get this shiny beauty of a fruit to shine a little more! Something worth noting from the transmutation of the sapling I used, is that the Wood from it may be a little sturdier than your average oak. Something I should consider noting...

research_name.thaumicbases:endtree=Garden of Pearlescent Fruit
research_stage.thaumicbases:endtree.1=From looking at the Golden Apple Tree, I've realized what a breakthrough this is. I've managed to make a tree that grows an entirely impossible fruit! Something embossed in gold to be of ultimate power, and on top of the fact that this can be farmed like many other trees makes this revelation more astounding than most Thaumaturges can dream of! I best calm my ego before it gets to the best of me, but something I've been wondering about is Ender Pearls. The Ender Pearl is extracted from...<BR>After having had a mental breakdown about where Ender Pearls come from, I will not write specifically where they come from, but focus on how I can get them without... viewing it in the worst way possible. I've come up with a solid theory of how to do so, and it involves the Eye of Ender.
research_stage.thaumicbases:endtree.2=Similar in concept to the Golden Apple Tree, however I replaced the apples with Ender Pearls and Ender Eyes respectively. Theoretically, I should be able to harvest the fragile Ender Pearls within the leaves if I am careful.

research_name.thaumicbases:inftree=Garden of Magmatic Fruit
research_stage.thaumicbases:inftree.1=From looking at the Golden Apple Tree, I've realized what a breakthrough this is. I've managed to make a tree that grows an entirely impossible fruit! Something embossed in gold to be of ultimate power, and on top of the fact that this can be farmed like many other trees makes this revelation more astounding than most Thaumaturges can dream of! I best calm my ego before it gets to the best of me, but something I've been wondering about is Magma Cream. Magma Cream is the mutilated, correctly extracted carcass of a molten Magma Cube, and while it may not be all that pleasant to think of, it's not as bad in comparison to figuring out where Ender Pearls come from. I've come up with a theory as to how to get Magma Cream more efficiently in comparison to slaughtering many. 
research_stage.thaumicbases:inftree.2=Similar in concept to the Golden Apple Tree, however I replaced the apples with Nether Wart and Blaze Powder respectively. Theoretically, I should be able to harvest the molten Magma Cream within the leaves if I am careful.

research_name.thaumicbases:peaceTree=Peaceful Tree
research_stage.thaumicbases:peaceTree.1=You have noticed that the animals of all kind are attracted to the light. You have also noticed that they can appear in different places out of nowhere.
research_stage.thaumicbases:peaceTree.2= You have studied that effect, and have managed to create a tree that will attract animals of all kind towards itself. The animals, corresponding to the biome the tree grows in will randomly appear beneath it's leaves. You should however keep control over the population, since animals will come endlessly!

research_name.thaumicbases:deco=Old News
research_stage.thaumicbases:deco.1=From what I've learned about the ancient past of the world I've lived in, this world used to look a lot different from what I've read in the local Village Library, debatably bad to some, but I am not one to judge the taste of those who enjoy nostalgic things. I still do not get why I've had the idea of bringing those textures back to the modern day... is this the modern day?
research_stage.thaumicbases:deco.2=Nothing a little bit of vis and elbowgrease won't... make ancient? I didn't think that would sound so dumb reading it back to myself, but regardless... I've managed to replicate the look of ancient blocks of similar ones that many knew from the past. I feel self-conscious about wrinkles on my face suddenly.

research_name.thaumicbases:deco2=Like a Glove
research_stage.thaumicbases:deco2.1=These blocks may not appeal all that look upon it, but that doesn't mean that I can't make blocks that'll appeal to my fellow colleagues. I've constructed an idea for thaumic blocks that can be made into something I can decorate with! Though... what materials could I use?
research_stage.thaumicbases:deco2.2=While older textures are nice to some, I've managed to create blocks that fit the needs of a Thaumaturge a little more. While the blocks I've utilized have been rather useless to me before when building my Infusion Altar. These blocks should help me make my altar look a little less ugly in comparison, along with the Altar being far more stable than before! 

research_name.thaumicbases:macerator=Crucible Crushing
research_stage.thaumicbases:macerator.1=I need some alternate ways of getting the materials I want, I can't get them myself, but I do have an idea as to how I'm gonna get them. Considering common logic of how some of these materials are normally gotten, this should theoretically be how I achieve such a thing.
research_stage.thaumicbases:macerator.2=Similar to a Macerator, I have achieved the ability to break down certain things, however... it's incredibly inefficient and doesn't guarantee that I can get what I need... wait. How the hell can I make gold out of Sand?

research_name.thaumicbases:advmacerator=Advanced Crucible Crushing
research_stage.thaumicbases:advmacerator.1=What I'm getting is not enough, I need to make more of these products. I have to do better, I need to be better. Time can only tell when I'm going to make my next big screw up, and I can't let it be soon. How am I going to fabricate more of what I'm trying to crush?
research_stage.thaumicbases:advmacerator.2=I looked back at the word "fabricate" for some reason before I began writing more theories, and the word stuck to my mind like glue. Then it hit me while I was researching machines. In order to Fabricate, I need Fabrico. I just need to sort out how I will manage to get the Herba vis out of the system. I should still have a few Quartz Slivers left over.

research_name.thaumicbases:compress=Refined Compression
research_stage.thaumicbases:compress.1=Without a proper way to double my resources, as far as I'm aware, I'm gonna need to take advantage of the materials that I can currently take advantage of. I can't just create a machine or a formula that turns stone into ore, or ore into more ore. However, that doesn't mean that I can't create more clusters out of ore!
research_stage.thaumicbases:compress.2=After contemplating a bit with myself about what I am doing, I managed to get my thoughts together. These additional crucible recipes should allow me to duplicate my resources further than I could before! With throwing in certain bits of Blaze Powder, I can yield up to 3 additional Blaze Rods upon using it at a Catalyst, what a deal! Along with other recipes yielding varying amounts of an object, it still proves to me that I'm able to create things out of nothing! Just like a Thaumaturge is able to do at their best! I should reward myself with being able to relax in the Arcane Spa.

research_name.thaumicbases:tbdouble=Avarice and Ambition
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbdouble.1=For someone who has done so much in this world, I can't seem to be satisfied with what I'm doing. Is it because I'm greedy? Am I becoming an idolater to insanity that's becoming blind to the truth of righteousness? I can't focus on that right now, my mind is trying to play tricks on me. I need to focus. I want to reconstruct some of the various materials that I've broken down before, so how will I do so? I'm gonna have to see.
research_stage.thaumicbases:tbdouble.2=I've found a way! It mainly has to do with doubling the essentia I put into the system, but nothing a little item arranging and Quartz Slivers can't fix. This should theoretically allow me to create more of what I've been trying to make in the first place. Clusters are now doubled! With a good Infernal Furnace setup in place, this could be the easiest and most efficient way of smelting that a Thaumaturge could dream of! 

research_name.thaumicbases:overchant=Beyond Enchanting
research_stage.thaumicbases:overchant.1=Try make awesome Mechanism! <- For some reason, this was written in the book when I opened the page to write about my next idea. I also can't seem to erase the text either, though I don't believe I can erase any of the things I write down in this book anyway. Side thoughts aside, my new idea for this particular section is a current struggle for more power on my tools and weapons, and the most I can do is simply Level 5... however, who is to stop me from going above and beyond? Who dares to stop me at the pinnacle of my power?! I'm, seemingly, the only one ballsy enough to go beyond enchanting.
research_stage.thaumicbases:overchant.2=I've sketched out a rough idea of what this device I'm dubbing "The Overchanting Table", the idea of this particular... machine? Can I even call this a machine? I can't look into the philosophies of it, I need to explain this.<BR>First and foremost, §l§nwhen using this machine, it will zap experience from your vessel, around 40% of your health, so be sure to have full health when doing this, as it ignores even the strongest of armors§r, regenerative items and device may help with mitigating that issue.<PAGE>With the warning out of the way, the Overchanting Table allows me to take enchantments that I've previously created using Enchanting Table, such as "§l§nSharpness V§r" and "§l§nUnbreaking III§r" and amping up its power by 1. The Overchanting Table will ignore previously empowered enchantments in favor of ones that can be upgraded.<BR>One thing to note about it however, is that it will only upgrade one at a time. It's best if I make sure my Experience is above 30 for each instance that I overenchant an item.<BR>§l§nThis machine will keep consuming essentia if you do not have the appropriate level of experience, so do keep that in mind!§r<BR>With a machine like this, I could make something truly worth beholding!

research_name.thaumicbases:spikes=Iron Spikes
research_stage.thaumicbases:spikes.1=Pesky mobs try to hinder my quest for intelligence. There must be a way that I can prevent this from happening, and the basic design I have down is a set of spikes that these foolish mobs can run into and stumble over. I shall oversee how this concept will work in my favor, but what could be used as an example of something that can trap things? Pressure plates?
research_stage.thaumicbases:spikes.2=My plan came together rather nicely! A set of Iron Spikes with a consistent amount of damage that cannot, however, be placed in any other way than upright. These spikes also tend to tear through things that mobs drop and completely consume them. I'm not very happy about the result, but there's always room for improvement when starting out with an idea.

research_name.thaumicbases:thaumspikes=Thaumium Spikes
research_stage.thaumicbases:thaumspikes.1=While the Iron Spikes were more or less a success in some places, that doesn't mitigate my dissatisfaction with its current place of utility. The Iron Spikes' biggest downfall when put into use is the fact that it causes any and all of the stuff I can scavenge from mob kills to be rendered useless because of how long they spend getting stabbed by the spikes. Along with the ability to not be able to deactivate them when I need to crossover them. From previously working with Thaumium and seeing its capabilities, perhaps it's worth experimenting embossing my spikes with Thaumium to upgrade them.
research_stage.thaumicbases:thaumspikes.2=I managed to reinforce my spikes with Thaumium, in theory, this will make the spikes a lot sharper, and far more deadly. These spikes also have 2 additional benefits to them, the first one being that it won't rip apart mob drops unlike its predecessor, and the second being that I can activate and deactivate them with a bit of connection to redstone! These spikes surely can't be improved anymore than what they can be... right? I think not.

research_name.thaumicbases:voidspikes=Void Spikes
research_stage.thaumicbases:voidspikes.1=Void metal, while low in durability, makes up for it with it's incredible ability to mend itself back together and resharpen itself as well! As it is a metal that derives from the never-ending void itself, and studying how much it hurts to poke a Flux Rift, I can conclude that this next theory should be worth some salt. While Thaumium normally doesn't resonate well with Void Metal, I think I can do something to make them play nicely together. 
research_stage.thaumicbases:voidspikes.2=They call me a madman, and for what? The use of Void to torture my foes to death? These Void Spikes should deal a massive amount of damage to regular mobs, killing them almost instantly. Similar to its Thaumium predecessor, this set of spikes does not skewer mob drops, along with being able to be activated and decativated with Redstone. These spikes are as powerful as they can get, with the void metal being able to synchronize with it's desire to eat away at the natural, its power is unmatched compared to its Thaumium counterpart. Surely now, I can make them pay.

research_name.thaumicbases:bloodfabric=Blood... Magic?
research_stage.thaumicbases:bloodfabric.1=My spikes seem to be getting bloodied from the monster's I've executed it with. And while I do quite enjoy the fact they're being made into mince from their blunders, I do wish that the spikes did not get as gruesome as they looked when I see the corpses of the undead in the morning, burning to a gruesome crisp. I tried scrubbing it off with wool, and sponge, but the blood does nothing but persist on it. I tried it on fresh kills, but it does nothing more than make me look like a fool that could stab their finger at any point. Though... I haven't considered using Enchanted Fabric yet.
research_stage.thaumicbases:bloodfabric.2=As I use more of my spikes, I'm starting to notice how messy they get. I should probably clean the spikes off, as they're rather... disgusting looking. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if I can get the blood off of the fabric, but I think I can do more with this than just wiping off the blood. I've created a set of clothes with... a rather odd set of bonuses, but they're helpful nonetheless.<PAGE>The §l§nBloody Thaumaturge Robes§r give me a vitality boost! Leaving me a fair bit healthier and more ready to endure the forces that are surely to come after me with monster blood drenched on these robes.<BR>The §l§nBloody Thaumaturge Leggings§r keep me in place, as to not get knocked around like a ball.<BR>Finally, the §l§nBloody Thaumaturge Boots§r give me an incredible speed boost! Allowing me to run wild as I escape the dangers of what lurks within when I look too deep into the Abyss.<BR>Now I just need a set of Bloody Goggles to match my bloody clothes... wait that makes me sound like a §5criminal§r.

research_name.thaumicbases:firemagic=A Lit Bonfire
research_stage.thaumicbases:firemagic.1=Long nights are a struggle when you're surrounded by monster's out to harm you, I can't even get a decent nights sleep with them banging on my walls to break through! If only there was a way for me to make them silence theirselves so I can move on with my research in the morning.
research_stage.thaumicbases:firemagic.2=I've constructed a strange oddity, a §l§nCampfire§r with a seemingly helpful, but maybe malicious property to it. While my original plan for this campfire was to scare mobs away, this campfire redirects it's smoke and flame to whip at mobs and smite them with the mighty power of gods! That'll show those pesky monsters.<BR>The §l§nBrazier§r on the other hand, is a lot safer for indoor use. Not only will the Brazier give Monsters what they sought after, but it also rejuvinates my body beyond my own belief! Finally, I can now focus on my research in peace.

research_name.thaumicbases:scythe=Speak Not of Him
research_stage.thaumicbases:scythe.1=While roaming through a village, I hear a fable from one of the villagers who seemed to be rambling on about something. Legends tell of a man who doesn't exist, a person without presence, a being without being. His name is "Herobrine" according to the villager that was telling the story, once he said the name, the villagers gathered around in fear. I can tell this Herobrine guy could be a real problem if he were to come into existence. Appearences, possessions, theft, markings. I can feel a reminiscense of these such happenings when holding the Nether Star, however... it could hold some meaning. If holding a vis crystal can tell me about my path to miracle-working, then there's gotta be something in that feeling with the Nether Star. 
research_stage.thaumicbases:scythe.2=The Nether Star proved to be an immaculately useful resource to study! And what came of it? So much more than I could've imagined! I call it the "Scythe of the White-Eyed One". While not being Minecraft's Grim Reaper, this scythe has proven itself to be an incredibly powerful weapon, not only does it repair itself far faster, thanks to the properties of the Void Hoe in which I infused it from, on top of the extra void metal and Nether Star I've used to shape the blade, you'll never break it! Along with the wondeful benefit of having it neve break, the Scythe also packs damage far greater than any tool I've previously created, making it a true beast of a tool to use. Further enchanting may further enhance the terror I can reek upon this unholy world.

research_name.thaumicbases:revolver=The Rootin Tootin Point
research_stage.thaumicbases:revolver.1=A lack of weaponry and utility on their belt makes a Thaumaturge a dead Thaumaturge. Unfortunately, I am close to being that Thaumaturge as of right now if I don't have a better way, something straight to the point and something I can tinker with later to make better. My current tools do not suffice this purpose as well, despite being enchantable, but beyond that they don't hold much other power to their name. I should study projectiles more, as I had done so with my spells.
research_stage.thaumicbases:revolver.2=A stretch, this may be, but this may be a solution to my problems with defense! It's a small but powerful ranged weapon that I can modify to my will, I dub it to be the "§lThaumaturge's Revolver§r"! In order for me to use the Revolver, it will require me to load bullets into the gun itself. Each shot fired will hit for an excruciating amount of damage to my foe, and can be modified depending on what I infuse enchant it with.<PAGE>I better leave my bookish malarkey in the dusty old library, for I have an adventure to get on with!

research_name.thaumicbases:revupgrades=Kill the Past
research_stage.thaumicbases:revupgrades.1=As previously mentioned in my section about the Thaumaturge's Revolver, I spoke of upgrades to the revolver... thinking about it now, I don't quite have the idea of what can be done to upgrade a gun, especially a Revolver such as this one. The only way I could think of learning about artillery augmentation would be through more study, perhaps I should take a visit to the village library and see if the librarian has any information on guns.
research_stage.thaumicbases:revupgrades.2=Creativity is the limit of man, but not for a Thaumaturge. Despite my previous cloud of uninventiveness, I've managed to think of some properties of a Revolver that could quite possibly make it more useful than just the base gun itself! While not initially satisfied with how the gun works, these enchantments should mitigate a lot of what I believe downgraded the gun before. Despite its high power when firing it, despite its simplistic bullet creation, it still didn't feel like a proper Thaumaturge's tool. These upgrades should give me more of that feeling that I made it myself, allow me to explain it in further detail.<PAGE>§lRevolver Upgrade: Sharpshooter§r<DIV>Upon realizing what an unsteady hand I have, I decided to make this upgrade to mitigate my terrible aim, and straighten out whenever I am aiming. Thankfully, this will soon make sure I can actually hit my target instead of the wall next to them.<DIV>§oConflicts§r: §lFastshot§r, §lReservation§r<BR>§oRanks§r: 1-5<PAGE>§lRevolver Upgrade: Spider-Killer§r<DIV>This particular upgrade to the revolver focuses its power on the creepy crawlies of the world, such as Spiders and Silverfish. Instead of having to burn down my house to cleanse them, I just need to get a good aim at their head, and fire away until they're gone!<DIV>§oConflicts§r: §lEmpowered§r, §lPurifying§r, §lDueling§r, and §lSilver-Cased§r<BR>§Ranks§r: 1-5<PAGE>§lRevolver Upgrade: Purifying§r<DIV>This particular enchantment allows me to do more damage to the creatures of the Otherworld. While roaming through possible Eldritch Dimensions, I may encounter rather monstrous creatures that want me to perish and deform to their will. Yet I shall not let that happen, a bullet to their head should do teach them that they can't twist my will.<DIV>§oConflicts§r: §lEmpowered§r, §lSpider-Killer§r, §lDueling§r, and §lSilver-Cased§r<BR>§oRanks§r: 1-5<PAGE>§lRevolver Upgrade: Dueling§r<DIV>This upgrade allows me to improve damage against other people, including Thaumaturges such as myself who may be misbehaving.<DIV>§oConflicts§r:§lEmpowered§r, §lSpider-Killer§r, §lPurifying§r, §lSilver-Cased§r<BR>§oRanks§r:1-5<PAGE>§lRevolver Upgrade: Mind-Sapping§r<DIV>This gives each bullet I fire a chance to reveal the secrets of the world when killing a creature.

research_name.thaumicbases:curioscraft=Curio Crafting
research_stage.thaumicbases:curioscraft.1=As a Thaumaturge, my strive for knowledge is something that many should recognize, whether or not I should have this knowledge is no one's business but my own. The issue I'm having is with how tedious and time-consuming (and item-consuming) my research has become, it makes it far more difficult for me to get the knowledge I need for my workings to work. This isn't all that much of an issue however, as I've previously researched a mystical plant called the "Rosa Mysteria", the Rosa Mysteria drops these strange... almost ancient curiosities. To which I can gain experience by crushing these "Knowledge Fragments" in my hands. However... it leaves me to wonder what I can do to further enhance that experience contained within the Knowledge Fragments. I've known ways of getting curiosities from extracting Amber Ore and travelling to §oa cold, empty plane of existence§r has proven to give me different types of curiosities. I don't know why I haven't tried making my own curiosities before.
research_stage.thaumicbases:curioscraft.2=With my recent findings upon experimenting with the Knowledge Fragment, I've concocted a formula in which the Knowledge Fragments acts as a catalyst to shape my curiosities. Putting in differing variations of essentia allow me to make differing types of curiosities! Of course these will require me to Fabricate these different curiosities along with their respective Knowledge Aspects, for example, if I were to want an Arcane Curiosity, I need to alchemize it with an Arcane Aspect. Illuminating Curiosity would need something that has to do with Intelligence. A Twisted Curiosity needs to be made with an aspect of the twisted. Each recipe has been marked on their respective tabs for more information.
research_stage.thaumicbases:curioscraft.3=As strange as it is, the Eldritch Curiosity didn't work with Fabrico, however, upon testing it with other aspects along with Alienis, it alchemized the best with Desiderium. Upon taking a moment to wonder why, I've concluded a few things about the Eldritch. Tales tell of a land beyond the human eye, a land in which the Otherworldly roam, it's not the End, but something called the Empty. A place such as this is to be considered highly dangerous and unstable, and within it lies an ancient structure of power. Unfortunately I cannot say that I have much more insight on it just yet without needing to make miscellaneous discoveries, but that's a story for another time. It should be worth noting that the proportions of this Curiosity should be similar to many of the other curiosities I've created.

research_name.thaumicbases:thaumanvil=Thaumium Anvil
research_stage.thaumicbases:thaumanvil.1=You are annoyed by those anvils. They are breaking after a coupe of hits and they are sapping your lifeforce as if they were some kind of experience blackhole!
research_stage.thaumicbases:thaumanvil.2=You have applied your knowledge of the magical metal otherwise known as thaumium to create a better anvil! The Thaumium Anvil lasts much longer than the mundane one, keeping full functionality! <BR>The Thaumium also is not your mundane iron - it can absorb much more lifeforce at a time, increasing the maximum level the anvil can work with up to 60. It also seems that reparing items here has no cost penalty - it is always as you are reparing your pick the first time!

research_name.thaumicbases:voidanvil=Void metal Anvil
research_stage.thaumicbases:voidanvil.1=Well, the Thaumium anvil is all well and good, but it also breaks. Maybe not that fast, but it still does. However, you have had an idea since you've unlocked that Void metal. What if you try to make an anvil out of that one?
research_stage.thaumicbases:voidanvil.2=The results are... Interesting.<BR>First of all, your new-made anvil has kept the main property of the void metal - the ability to repare itself. The anvil will automatically repare itself, should you cause a block update right next to it. The anvil however acts much different - any operation here, no matter if you are renaming stuff or combining extremely efficient enchanted books always costs the same 7 levels of XP. <PAGE>The anvil also seems to have no cost increase penalty, just as the thaumium one does.<BR>Whlist reparing you have seen some void metal flowing into the cracks of your tools. Sure that is nothing to worry about, right?
