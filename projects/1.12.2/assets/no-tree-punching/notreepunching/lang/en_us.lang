notreepunching.guide.intro.page.1=“Don’t punch trees.” - AlcatrazEscapee
notreepunching.guide.intro.page.2=This mod adds a few new mechanics, a bit of world gen, and changes the way blocks are broken.
notreepunching.guide.intro.page.3=Blocks now will only drop their drops if you use the correct tool. If you aren’t using the correct tool, blocks will take significantly longer to mine.
notreepunching.guide.intro.page.4=There are a few additional rules: Metal pickaxes are able to break dirt-type materials without penalty, Mattocks function as both a saw and a shovel, and any block can be whitelisted in the config to disable this behavior.
notreepunching.guide.intro.page.5=Some loose rocks on the ground
notreepunching.guide.intro.page.6=This mod adds one small piece of world gen: Loose rocks. They are found lying on the ground, in different types. Sandstone rocks are only found on top of sand, the rest are found everywhere.
notreepunching.guide.intro.page.7=In addition to the world gen and breaking changes, No Tree Punching adds a few new mechanics and devices. It adds knapping to get flint tools and a log chopping mechanic to chop logs into smaller pieces. NTP also adds a fire pit, a basic pottery system, and more. Enjoy!

notreepunching.guide.early_game.page.8=Any axe can be used to chop wood into smaller parts. It is not very effective, and it is even less effective with a flint hatchet. Place a log on a solid surface (not a wooden one) and right click. After a few tries, the log will break into planks. You can also chop planks into sticks.

notreepunching.guide.pottery.page.3=Unfired pottery (clay) can be fired in two ways: in a fire pit or in a furnace. Each pottery item has its own unique uses when fired.
notreepunching.guide.pottery.page.4=The clay tool can also be used for crafting. By crafting it with clay balls, you can make clay bricks, which can be smelted into normal bricks. You can also craft clay blocks into four clay bricks.
notreepunching.guide.pottery.page.5=The large vessel is an inventory that can hold nine items when placed. It does not retain its inventory when picked up.
notreepunching.guide.pottery.page.6=The small vessel is a portable storage container that can hold four items. You can also place small vessels inside other small vessels for nearly infinite storage!
