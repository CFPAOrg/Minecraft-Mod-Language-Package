controlledburn.config.globalMultipliers=Global Multipliers
controlledburn.config.globalMultipliers.tooltip=Multipliers for how fast fire naturally spreads and how fast fire burns blocks\n\nAlso includes the setting for how often fire updates (which makes everything fire-related faster or slower)\n \n
controlledburn.config.specialToggles=Special Toggles
controlledburn.config.specialToggles.tooltip=Includes whether certain sources can start fires, whether fire ignores rain, and other oddities\n \n

controlledburn.config.burnSpreadChances.tooltip=These determine how often fire spreads to adjacent blocks after burning a block\n \n
controlledburn.config.spreadRanges=Fire Spread Ranges / Reach
controlledburn.config.spreadRanges.tooltip=How far fire can naturally spread from one block to another in each direction\n \n
controlledburn.config.spreadStrengths=Spread Strengths (Advanced)
controlledburn.config.spreadStrengths.tooltip=How much "life" new fires have when spreading\n \n
controlledburn.config.blockSpecific=Block-Specific Settings (Advanced)
controlledburn.config.blockSpecific.tooltip=This allows you to set a custom BASE flammability and encouragement for any given block\n\nThe EFFECTIVE stats of the block will be these values times their respective multipliers\n\nFlammability is how fast/easily the block is destroyed by fire\n\nEncouragement is how fast/easily fire spreads to the block\n\nThe equals symbol can be used to leave a base stat as-is (eg, if you only want to change one stat)\n\nSetting flammability to a negative value makes a block behave like netherrack (as far as fire goes)\n\nSyntax is [blockID, flammability, encouragement]. Examples below\nminecraft:grass, 5, 5\nminecraft:dirt, =, 5\n \n
controlledburn.config.blockTransformations=Block Transformations
controlledburn.config.blockTransformations.tooltip=This allows you to set what a block will become when it burns\nEg. you can make grass blocks turn to dirt by using this setting:\nminecraft:grass, minecraft:dirt\n\nKeep in mind that this won't do anything unless you make sure the first block is actually flammable (and maybe give it encouragement too, depending; see the MC wiki for more info on those stats)\n \n

controlledburn.config.burnSpeedMultiplier=Burn Speed Multiplier
controlledburn.config.burnSpeedMultiplier.tooltip=How fast blocks are destroyed (burnt) when 'on fire', as a multiplier (2 means twice as fast, 0.5 means half as fast)\n\nAKA flammability multiplier\n\nSet this to 0 to make it so fire doesn't break (burn) blocks at all (but can still be lit)\n \n
controlledburn.config.spreadSpeedMultiplier=Spread Speed Multiplier
controlledburn.config.spreadSpeedMultiplier.tooltip=How fast fire spreads, as a multiplier (2 means twice as fast, 0.5 means half as fast)\n\nAKA encouragement multiplier\n \n
controlledburn.config.tickDelay=Tick Delay
controlledburn.config.tickDelay.tooltip=The number of game ticks before fire blocks update themselves\n\nThe lower you set this, the faster fire works (in every way)\n \n
controlledburn.config.tickDelayRandomization=Tick Delay Randomization
controlledburn.config.tickDelayRandomization.tooltip=By default, MC adds 0-9 ticks to each tick delay\n\nThe lower you set this, the faster fire works (in every way), and the less random it works, time-wise (but not to any noticeable degree for the latter)\n \n

controlledburn.config.ignoreHumid=Ignore Humid Biomes
controlledburn.config.ignoreHumid.tooltip=If set to true, fire ignores the fire resistance of humid biomes\n\nThis affects block destruction (burn) chance and natural fire spread chance in humid biomes\n \n
controlledburn.config.ignoreRain=Ignore Rain
controlledburn.config.ignoreRain.tooltip=If set to true, fire ignores rain\n\nWHEN IT'S RAINING this affects chance of fire extinguishing from rain, chance of natural fire spread, and chance of fire spread when fire destroys (burns) a block\n \n
controlledburn.config.lavaFire=Disable Fires From Lava
controlledburn.config.lavaFire.tooltip=Whether fire spreading from lava is disabled\n \n
controlledburn.config.lightningFire=Disable Fires From Lightning
controlledburn.config.lightningFire.tooltip=Whether fire spreading from lightning is disabled\n \n
controlledburn.config.losFireSpread=LOS-Only Fire Spread
controlledburn.config.losFireSpread.tooltip=Whether fire requires line-of-sight to spread to a new location\n \n

controlledburn.config.maxBurnSpreadChance=Max Burn Spread Chance
controlledburn.config.maxBurnSpreadChance.tooltip=When a fire at the MAXIMUM age (15 in vanilla) destroys (burns through) a block, the chance that the broken (burnt) block is replaced with fire\n\nDoes nothing if fire never destroys blocks, eg. if dontDestroyBlocks is set to true\n\nUses a full-number percentage (25 means 25% chance, 75 means 75% chance)\n \n
controlledburn.config.minBurnSpreadChance=Min Burn Spread Chance
controlledburn.config.minBurnSpreadChance.tooltip=When a fire at the MINIMUM age (0 in vanilla) destroys (burns through) a block, the chance that the broken (burnt) block is replaced with fire\n\nDoes nothing if fire never destroys blocks, eg. if dontDestroyBlocks is set to true\n\nUses a full-number percentage (25 means 25% chance, 75 means 75% chance)\n \n

controlledburn.config.reachUp=Reach (Upwards)
controlledburn.config.reachUp.tooltip=The maximum upward distance fire can naturally spread to when updating (eg. between two trees)\n \n
controlledburn.config.reachDown=Reach (Downwards)
controlledburn.config.reachDown.tooltip=The maximum downward distance fire can naturally spread to when updating (eg. between two trees)\n \n
controlledburn.config.reachSide=Reach (Sideways)
controlledburn.config.reachSide.tooltip=The maximum horizontal distance fire can naturally spread to when updating (eg. between two trees)\n \n

controlledburn.config.burnSpreadStrength=Spread Strength (Block Destroyed)
controlledburn.config.burnSpreadStrength.tooltip=When fire spreads by destroying a block, the new fire's duration is set to the duration of the fire it came from, multiplied by this\n\nFire's lifetime is only measured in integers from 0 to 15, so if you set the percentage to anything lower than 7 it will be the same as if you set it to 0\n\nUses a full-number percentage (25 means 25% strength, 75 means 75% strength)\n\nThe normal vanilla fire mechanics don't use a percentage reduction like this, so set this to -1 if you want vanilla mechanics in this regard\n \n
controlledburn.config.naturalSpreadStrength=Spread Strength (Natural Spread)
controlledburn.config.naturalSpreadStrength.tooltip=When fire spreads naturally, ie. not when it's spreading by destroying (burning) a block, the new fire's duration is set to the duration of the fire it came from, multiplied by this\n\nFire's lifetime is only measured in integers from 0 to 15, so if you set the percentage to anything lower than 7 it will be the same as if you set it to 0\n\nUses a full-number percentage (25 means 25% strength, 75 means 75% strength)\n\nThe normal vanilla fire mechanics don't use a percentage reduction like this, so set this to -1 if you want vanilla mechanics in this regard\n \n
