Ports are the first letters of: Red,\n§7Blue, Yellow, Green, Up, and Down.\n§7You program it with a set of math expressions. All code \n§7lines are calculated in the same tick (read inputs ->\n§7calculate -> write outputs). The code is case insensitive\n§7(\"R\" is the same as \"r\"). You can also set own variables,\n§7their values will be retained until the RLC is stopped.\n§7Parse errors are marked (hover that) and prevent\n§7to start the program.\n\n§7Click the RUN/STOP button to start or stop a program.\n§7Hover the RLC symbol to see internal variable values\n§7(only when running). The port list shows the current\n§7signal values, and if a port is input, output, or unused.\n§7Copy/paste clipboard button, needless to say ;)",

If you use a port variable (that is\n§7not already output) in an expression, it is automatically\n§7set to input.\n§7Comparator-Outputs of adjacent blocks are read with\n§7the \".CO\" suffix. E.g. \"Y = MAX( B.CO, R, g.co, MyVar )\".\n§7CO's are never RLC outputs, even if you assign them.",

As the values are numbers,\n§7you can directly calculate with them. E.g. \"G=(R>11)/3\"\n§7results in 5 or 0. However, better would be instead\n§7using the IF function: \"G = IF( R>11, 5, 0 )\".",

  "block.redstonepen.control_box.help.7": "§nTimers§r§7 in PLCs are signal based. The dominant three\n§7are implemented in the RLC: TON, TOF, and TP:\n§7TON is a Switch-On-Delay.

TP generates a pulse\n§7for a specified time when seeing a rising edge of the input\n§7signal.
