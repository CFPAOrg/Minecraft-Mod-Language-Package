Quartz
Technologies from this world
You cannot visit Nether anymore, but you still need some Quartz for Electronics? Not a problem! Now you can find in TFC Overworld Quartz Geodes, which can contain Quartz Blocks and Quartz Clusters!
It can be helpful for crafting electronics from the Immersive Engineering! Also, keep in mind, that with time Budding Quartz Blocks can produce more Quartz Clusters.
