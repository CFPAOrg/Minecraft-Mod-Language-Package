Graphite
Coal stuff
Highly Ordered Pyrolytic Graphite (HOP) is a complex, highly compressed, carbon material used in special engineering constructs.
HOP Graphite Dust is created by compressing eight pieces of Coke Dust or Graphite Powder in the <link;squeezer;Industrial Squeezer>. That dust can then be smelted into an ingot.
<&electrode>The most common use for HOP Graphite is the creation of electrodes to be used in the <link;arc_furnace;Arc Furnace>. These electrodes are created with an <link;blueprints;Engineer's Blueprint>, which can be crafted. You can also create electrodes in the <link;metal_press;Metal Press>, using the Rod Mold on 4 ingots, but the electrodes crafted this way only have half the durability.
