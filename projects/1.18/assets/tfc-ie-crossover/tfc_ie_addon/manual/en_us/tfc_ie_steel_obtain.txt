Steel Creation
Not So Simple Steel

In the TerraFirmaCraft World it is not so easy to create a Steel Ingot. Now you have to follow full process of forging the ingots from Pig Iron to Steel. Luckily, this process can be simplified later. Also, Slag now can be obtained while you are forging Pig Iron Ingot to get High Carbon Steel Ingot.
