Herbicide Additions
Better than Rotten Compost
<link;herbicide;Herbicide> works in the TerraFirmaCraft World too! When loaded into a <link;chemthrower;Chemical Thrower> it is dispersed as a fine mist, which withers and destroys any plants it comes in contact with.
The fluid will destroy flowers and crops and strip the grass from dirt. It will also dehydrate and ruin farmland. It can therefore be used as an alternative to Rotten Compost.<br>
<&mixing>To craft Herbicide, mix half a bucket of <link;fermenter;Ethanol> with §2Malachite Powder§r and §2Sulfur§r in the <link;mixer;Mixer>.
