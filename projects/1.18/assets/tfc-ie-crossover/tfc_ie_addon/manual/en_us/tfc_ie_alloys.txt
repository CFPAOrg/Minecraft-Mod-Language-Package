New Alloys
Do not get burned!
Since TerraFirmaCraft adds alloy crafting system, now you have possibility to create Immersive Engineering Alloys like Electrum or Constantan in TFC style!
All you have to know are proportions for both alloys (they are pretty easy, trust me).
To create Electrum Alloy you will need to mix 40-60% of Molten Gold and 40-60% of Molten Silver.
Same story is about Constantan, which consists of 40-60% of Molten Copper and 40-60% of Molten Nickel.
