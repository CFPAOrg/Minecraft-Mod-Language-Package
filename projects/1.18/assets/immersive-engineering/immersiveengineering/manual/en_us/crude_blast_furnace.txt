Crude Blast Furnace
Simple Steel
<&block>The Crude Blast Furnace is used to increase the carbon contents in iron, turning it into §2steel§r. To achieve this, only pure, high-carbon fuels may be used for the furnace, specifically <link;cokeoven;coal coke and charcoal>.
<&outputs>Along with steel, the furnace will also create §2slag§r, which you must remove or the furnace will cease to function. While it is technically a waste product, there are various ways to <link;slag;recycle> it.<np>
<&multiblock>To form a Blast Furnace, arrange 27 of these blocks in a 3x3x3 cube, and rightclick one of the sides' center blocks with an Engineer's Hammer.
The Crude Blast Furnace is §lnot§r automateable. All in- and outputs must be arranged manually through its GUI. If you want to automate the creation of steel, you should probably look into creating an <link;improved_blast_furnace;Improved Blast Furnace;>.
