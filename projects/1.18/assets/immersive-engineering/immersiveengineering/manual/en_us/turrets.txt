Turrets
Are you still there?
Turrets are the next step is automated defense of your factory. They feature a complex optical system combined with an electronic "brain" to effectively distinguish and acquire targets and use the inbuilt weaponry to neutralize them.
All turrets feature energy ports at their base, and require a redstone signal to be active, although this behavior can be inverted by sneaking and rightclicking it with an Engineer's Screwdriver.<np>
Upon being placed, Turrets will remember their owner and will not allow other users to break or modify them. Rightclicking the turret brings up the GUI which features a list of names with an entry field, as well as multiple targeting options.
By the default the list is a blacklist of targets that may not be attacked. This list utilizes creature names, so whitelisting animals is possible.<np>
<&turret_chemthrower_recipe>The Chemthrower Turret utilizes the fluid propelling capabilities of the <link;chemthrower;eponymous tool;start> to cover targets in anything, ranging from water to douse flames, to diesel oil to start them.<np>
This Turret features a fluid port in the bottom and back of the base to allow pipes to connect to it. Additionally, the GUI has a button on the left which dis- or enables the pilot flame, igniting the dispensed fluid, provided that it is flammable.

<&turret_gun_recipe>The Gun Turret features a heavily modified version of the <link;revolver;Revolver's;start> internals in a far bigger and more imposing casing. The construction also involves an extended magazine to allow for increased internal storage of ammunition.<np>
A port for the automatic insertion of ammo and extraction of spent casing is located within the back and bottom of the base. This Turret can store up to a full stack of cartridges and the GUI features a button to toggle the automatic expulsion of spent casings.

§oNote that certain ammunitions may cause collateral damage to the user or their property.§r
