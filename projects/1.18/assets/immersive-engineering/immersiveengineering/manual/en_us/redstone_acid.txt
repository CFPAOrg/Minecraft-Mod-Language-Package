Redstone Acid
Colourful electrolyte!
While the exact properties of Redstone remain a mystery even to the most studied engineers, recent experiments have shown it be an acidic salt, creating Redstone Acid when dissolved in water.
The acid is not strong enough to dissolve organic matter, but it is mildly corrosive to metal and acts as an excellent electrolyte for <link;accumulators;Accumulators;recipes>.<br>
<&mixer>For mass production, the acid can be easily created in a <link;mixer;Mixer>, using 1 piece of §2Redstone Dust§r for one quarter of a bucket of water.
<&copper>When used in a <link;chemthrower;Chemthrower> it can be used to oxidize copper blocks, producing a beautiful patina. The same effect can be achieved by using a <link;bottling_machine;Bottling Machine>, using an eighth of a bucket to age a block of copper.
