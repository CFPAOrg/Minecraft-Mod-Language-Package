Bottling Machine
Fill 'er up!
<&multiblock>The Bottling Machine fills fluids into containers.
The structure is created as shown above, but can be mirrored. To form it, rightclick the central conveyor with an Engineer's Hammer. The direction of the conveyors is important.<np>
The machine can store 8 buckets of fluid, which is input through the ports on the metal tank. Energy is input through the connection at the top of the opposing side.<br>
Generally, the Bottling Machine will be able to fill any container that has a filled version available (bucket, glass bottle). It will also accept other items that can store fluids, like the <link;mining_drill;Mining Drill;start> or a <link;jerrycan;Jerrycan;start>.
The machine will hold onto a container until it is completely full, or the machine is not being supplied with any more fluid. This allows it to fill even larger containers, provided it receives a steady input of fluid.
This behavior can be disabled by sneaking and rightclicking it with an Engineer's Hammer.<np>
<&potions>The machine can be used to bottle any potions that were brewed in the <link;mixer;Mixer>.<br>
Additionally, it serves to create <link;plastic;duroplast items;duroplast_sheet> from resin and <link;redstone_acid;oxidize copper blocks;copper> with redstone acid.
