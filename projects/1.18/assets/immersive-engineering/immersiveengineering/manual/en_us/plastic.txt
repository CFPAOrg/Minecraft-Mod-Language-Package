Resin and Duroplast
It's fantastic!
<&resin>Phenolic Resin is a sticky, viscous fluid, which can be molded into a resilient plastic known as Duroplast. This incredible new material is rigid, non-flammable and not conductive, making it an excellent insulator in electrical engineering.
Additionally, its ability to be molded makes it far more reliable in mass production than wood or ceramics.<np>
<&acetaldehyde>Its production process however is more involved and relies on complex chemical processes only possible within a <link;refinery;§o§nRefinery§r>.<br>
First, <link;fermenter;Ethanol;start> gained from fermenting plants must be oxidized to become Acetaldehyde. This process is done by using a §2Silver Plate§r as a catalyst and filling one of the refinery's tanks with Ethanol, while the other tank remains empty.
The resulting Acetaldehyde is then transferred to a §osecond§r refinery, where it is combined with <link;cokeoven;Creosote Oil> to create §2Phenolic Resin§r. This process requires no catalyst.<np>
<&duroplast_sheet>Duroplast items are created by filling appropriate <link;metal_press;molds;mold_recipes> with resin in the <link;bottling_machine;§o§nBottling §o§nMachine§r>. The machine is able to confer enough heat and pressure within these molds to trigger the resin to harden.<br>
The resulting sheets are used in the creation of <link;components;Advanced Electronic Components;elec_components> and <link;components;Circuit Backplanes;pcb>, where they act as insulators.<np>
<&duroplast_block>Solid blocks of duroplast can be used for construction and decorational purposes, though not everyone appreciates their colour. More importantly however, they serve to replace §2Terracotta§r when crafting <link;wiring;wire connectors and relays;connector_recipes>, thus reducing the amount of clay required!<np>
<&fiberboard>Fiberboard is made from compressed <link;sawmill;sawdust;sawdust>, mixed with resin to create a dense and compressed block. It shares its properties with wood and can be used as a replacement for planks in most recipes. An excellent way to recycle what would otherwise be waste!
<&empty_shell> You can also use resin in the creation of empty shells for the <link;bullets;Revolver's cartridges;empty>, making them cheaper and easier to mass produce.
