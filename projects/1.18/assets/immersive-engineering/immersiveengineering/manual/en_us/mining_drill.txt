Mining Drill
My drill will pierce the Bedrock!
<&drill_base_recipes>The handheld, diesel-powered drill is a big advancement in mining. With exchangeable drill heads and upgrades, its properties are almost entirely modifiable. To modify it, place it in an <link;workbench;Engineer's Workbench;start>. The drill runs off of <link;refinery;Biodiesel;diesel> and can be filled directly in the refinery.
The drill digs in an area depending on the drill head used, but you can sneak to limit it to a single block. You can also sneak and right-click to change the drill into single-block mode.<np>
<&drill_head_recipes>The §2Drill Head§r determines the base §2mining level§r, §2speed§r, and §2size§r, as well as the §2attack damage§r. As you dig blocks, the drill head takes damage, but it can be repaired in an anvil.<np>
<&drill_waterproof_recipe>As the drill is powered by a combustion engine, it will not run underwater unless you equip it with the §2Pressurized Air Tank§r Upgrade. However, with this upgrade equipped, it will not only run while submerged, but also ignore the slowdown usually experienced when digging in water.<np>
<&drill_lube_recipe>The §2Advanced Lubrication System§r applied additional lubricant to the drill at a regular basis, decreasing the durability loss of the drill head.<np>
<&drill_damage_recipe>By adding §2Additional Augers§r to the drill, its destructive potential is increased, increasing its damage against living creatures and allowing it to run and dig faster. The upgrade stacks up to three times.<np>
<&drill_capacity_recipe>The §2Large Fuel Tank§r allows the drill to store more fuel internally, extending the time you can use it before refilling.
