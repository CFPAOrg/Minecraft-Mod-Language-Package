Basic Wiring
Bzzzt!
The energy-net of Immersive Engineering has four important blocks: §lconnectors§r as inputs and outputs for the net, §lrelays§r to connect wires together and §ltransformers§r to switch between different levels of wire.<np>
<&wire_recipes>To connect two blocks, simply click the first one with a wire coil, then use the same coil on the second block. The total transfer rate between two points depends on the weakest type of wire between them.
<&images>Note that restrictions apply based on blocks: Connectors and relays will only take wires of the same type that is already connected, transformers will only take two wires of a different type, and wires can only connect to blocks that match the voltage. There are two important values to note about wiring:
Each connector has an input value (§o<config;iA;machines.wireConnectorInput>§r) and each wire has a maximum transfer rate (§o<config;iA;wires.wireTransferRate;l3>§r).
The connector limits how much power can be in- and output, but multiple connectors can §ounify§r into a single wire, allowing you to combine the transfer over longer ranges. Note however that the §omaximum transfer rate of the wire must not be exceeded, or else the wire will §oburn up§r.<br>
Wires will transfer energy even through §ounloaded chunks§r as long as the input and output chunks are loaded.<br>
Uninsulated wires connected to an energy source will cause damage to players and mobs too close to them. Insulated wires are available for low and medium voltage.<br>
Sneaking when using the "Pick Block" function on a connector will pick the connected wire from your inventory.<br>
Wire connections will break if a block obstructing the wire is placed.<np>
<&connector_recipes>§lConnectors§r serve as in- and outputs to the energy-net. You can place them on accumulators or other Flux handlers and they will transfer power through connected wires. §lRelays§r can't in- or output, they serve as connection points between wires.<np>
<&transformer_recipes>§lTransformers§r allow you to transition between different types of wire. The weakest wire restricts the transfer rate. Note that HV Transformers can step down to LV or MV, so you do not need to chain two transformers.
You can attach <link;this;transformers to wooden poles;images+1> as shown on the second image on page 4, however only non-HV Transformers can be placed like this.<np>
<&wirecutter_recipe>The §lWire Cutters§r are used to remove all the wires connected to a block by simply rightclicking it.<np>
<&voltmeter_recipe>The §lMultimeter§r is used to measure connections. Aiming it at any energy storage or rightclicking it will read its current storage. Sneak+rightclick two connectors to calculate the average loss between them.
It can also be used to read redstone levels.<np>
<&feedthrough>Feedthrough Insulators allow connecting wiring from one side of a wall to wiring on the other side without a hole. They can be created with any "normal" solid block in the middle, by right clicking either of two connectors. All common types of connectors (power and redstone) can be used to create feedthrough insulators for the corresponding wire type.
