Slag Recycling
Zero Waste!
<&slag_gravel>While slag is considered a waste product from the <link;crude_blast_furnace;Blast Furnace>, its mineral composition allows it to be reused in various ways!
§2Slag gravel§r is slag that has been processed in the <link;crusher;Crusher> to a rough grit. It shares its behavior with any other gravel, and can be crushed further into sand.
Additionally, slag gravel contains valuable nutrients for aquatic flora. Any water plants planted on in (such as kelp) tend to grow faster than when grown on other blocks.
<br><&slag_glass>By melting slag in a normal furnace rather than crushing it, it becomes §2slag glass§r, a hard, semi-transparent material. It reduces the strength of light passing through it and can be used as an insulator in <link;wiring;high-voltage relays;connector_recipes>.<np>
Due to its nutritional properties, slag also makes for an ingredient in <link;chemicals;industrial fertilizer;fertilizer>.
<br>Lastly, with the ability to crush it into gravel and sand, slag makes up two thirds of a <link;concrete;concrete mixture>, making it very useful for large construction efforts.
