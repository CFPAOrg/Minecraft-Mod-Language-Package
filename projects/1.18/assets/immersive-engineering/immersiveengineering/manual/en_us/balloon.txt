Balloon
...just make 99 of them
<&recipe>Balloons are sacks of fabric with a heatsource below to keep them afloat. They will emit light, but despite the torch, they are not a fire hazard.
Balloons can be placed like normal blocks, or when no block is targeted, they will be placed in the air infront of you.
Similar to <link;metalconstruction;Structural Connectors;connector_recipes> you can attach Hemp Rope and Steel Wire to the balloon.
Sneak-clicking allows you to set a height offset for the balloon, allowing you to place it up to 5 blocks above the target.
You can also use dyes on a placed balloon; which part you dye depends on where you target it.
Rightclicking with an Engineer's Hammer will toggle the balloon's design between horizontal or vertical stripes.
