External Heater
Now you're cooking with flux!
<&recipe>The External Heater does exactly what its name implies, it generates thermal energy from Flux. When placed next to a normal furnace, this thermal energy will power the furnace, allowing it to smelt without any fuel inside it.<np>
Click a side of the heater with a hammer to make ir an energy acceptor, sneak to target the opposing side.
The heater will consume §o8 Flux/t§r for each heat unit added. During the initial phase of the furnace, the heater will produce up to §o4§r units of heat per tick, but as soon as the furnace reaches maximum temperature, it will only require §o1§r unit of heat to keep it going.<np>
Even better, while the furnace is at maximum temperature, the heater will consume an additional §o24 Flux/t§r to increase the furnaces's processing speed. The heater will only affect a furnace with a valid input and space in the output slot, in order to conserve energy. However, you can apply a redstone signal to the heater to disable that functionality and have it keep the furnace at full heat.
