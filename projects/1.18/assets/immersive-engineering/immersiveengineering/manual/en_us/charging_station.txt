Charging Station
Charge your glasses!
<&recipe>The Charging Station is a device that allows you to charge tools and other items.
Energy can be input through the bottom or the back and items can be placed in manually or inserted automatically.<np>
The electron tubes at the front give a feedback about the current charge of the item, but the block will also output a comparator signal for the same purposes.
