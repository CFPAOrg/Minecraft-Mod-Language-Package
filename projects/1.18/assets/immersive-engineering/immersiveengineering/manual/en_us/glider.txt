Collapsible Glider
Sailing through the skies
<&recipe>§oThe villagers tell stories about cities in the sky, guarded by dragons, where brave adventurers may acquire magical wings that let them glide through the air.§r
<br>Humbug, surely - but the concept intrigues the engineer's mind. The §2Collapsible Glider§r is a device that affords just such liberties, allowing you to sail through the skies.
<br>It performs the same tasks as the "Elytra" that the villagers spoke of, but comes with a few downsides: It has lower durability and lacks any magical potential for enchantments.
Its lightweight construction of hemp and aluminium also makes it struggle with high speeds, taking increased damage when used in nose dives or accelerated by fireworks.
Its materials are easily acquired however and it can easily be repaired with some hemp fabric...provided it does not break completely during a high-speed dive.
