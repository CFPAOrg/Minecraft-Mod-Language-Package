Crafting Components
Integral Pieces
Many machines and tools are constructed from various sub-components. Some of these you will have to use on a regular basis, which is why they have their own entry in this manual. The §2Iron§r and §2Steel Mechanical Components§r are integral to the majority of Multiblocks and machinery.<np>
<&create_bp>As you will find yourself creating these components more frequently, it may be advisable to draft a <link;blueprints;Blueprint> for them.
<&mech_components>Using this blueprint in an <link;workbench;Engineer's Workbench> will allow you to construct the components at a reduced cost.<np>
<&elec_components>§2Electronic Components§r are more complicated and less commonly used than their mechanical counterpart. They are however essential for any devices with an extended level of control such as the <link;item_batcher;Item Batcher> or <link;turrets;Turrets>.<np>
<&light_bulbs>§2Incandescent Light Bulbs§r are made of a carbonized bamboo or paper filament which produce light and warmth when powered. They are primarily used to craft <link;lighting;lanterns;electric_lantern>.<np>
<&tubes>Another, albeit less frequently used component are §2Vacuum Tubes§r. These expensive ingredients are used in <link;logic_circuits;logic circuits> and more complex electronic machinery.<np>
<&pcb>The §2Circuit Backplane§r is an insulated copper board that can have a variety of components soldered to it in order to create <link;logic_circuits;Logic Circuits>.
