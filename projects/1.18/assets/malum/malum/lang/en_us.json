  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.altar_acceleration.runewood_obelisk.1": "Spirit Infusion, as essential as it is, has grown to be tedious. Even producing a stack of simple Hex Ash takes several minutes. Using a Hallowed Spirit Resonator, I have found a way to accelerate it.

For an Impetus, the repair material $iis/$ the spirits instead. The repair material must be placed on a Twisted Tablet facing the Crucible.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.arcane_restoration.3": "It appears that materials in tune with spirit arcana, such as Soulstained Steel or Hallowed Gold, are more efficient in this process. They will be repaired more than their mundane counterparts would for the same cost.",

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.arcane_rite.description.3": "And once altered, the wood's color changes, along with its magical disposition.

All of these impurities can be harnessed, and beyond that, I can infuse this power into my magic.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.belt_of_the_starved.2": "Doing this carries the perhaps predictable effect that my own hunger amplifies, draining quicker in the process. And... by eating things which revile me, things which are rotten, this powerful effect is extended beyond it's natural duration. The magic proficiency this grants is immense, but... I must say, the means are rather distasteful.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.belt_of_the_starved.ring_of_desperate_voracity.1": "To combat the toxic nature of these foods, I have created a ring to alleviate some of these effects.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.blight.arcane_rite.1": "That echo is why this substance is important for the Unchained Rite. The Rite remembers the violence of its creation, and resonates with the memory within the blight, applying its power to things laying on top of it.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.blight.composition.1": "The Undirected Rite, as the name suggests, is random. It transmutes, but it has no pattern to transmute things to. So, instead, you get something random, bits of disparate matter all jumbled together into a foul-smelling powder. I wouldn't recommend eating it, or growing things on it, but it's otherwise harmless.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.blight.intro.1": "Blight. $iSomething which spoils or damages./$ What the Undirected Rite has created has many strange properties, and I intend to categorize them.\nThe na\u00EFve explanation is that it is simply another form of power that taints the world, but that isn't right. Blight isn't harmful, not inof itself. It's just... $igunk./$",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.blight.spread.1": "Blight does not spread on its own. It's just random matter, after all. But it has a spiritual memory, a pattern which to replicate. When given arcana, or a valid fertilizer, blight will haphazardly echo this pattern on the nearby area.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.brilliance.1": "Brilliance is a term I have heard bandied about for what others call experience. It is a part of the soul, though improperly attached, and can be collected and used for enchanting and repairs.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.brilliance.2": "What many don't know is that it can condense into a physical form. I have heard rumors of solid Brilliance coming from crushing ore, but the most reliable source is small clusters of ore where a soul faded away, leaving its experiences engraved on the stone.",

It takes time for it to coalesce the power of the arcana into the central item. This isn't without reason. Most matter simply can't take a faster stream, and you risk damaging the catalyst by overloading it.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.crucible_acceleration.2": "However, by heating the catalyst through mystic means, you can lessen this rejection and speed up the coalescence at once.

I find it in very few beings, and those I find it in are those who already defy explanation.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ether.2": "A peculiarity of Ether's flame is that it resonates with colors. As if it was leather to be dyed, I can tint its appearance. It is an emitter of light, so dyeing it darker colors will lower the intensity rather than change the color of the flame itself.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ether.iridescent.1": "As if this was not enough, I have found a way to imbue a second color into my Ether, creating Iridescent Ether. When created, this form of Ether locks in its original color, leaving a new, $isecond/$ color open to dyeing. The light will shift from the original color into the new color towards the peak of the flames.",

Normally, after being struck by any attack, soul ward will not recover until a long moment after. That moment of downtime has proven itself detrimental far too frequently. But that ends now.",

The strength of this effect is exponentially proportional to the amount of damage taken, but lasts for only a single strike.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_the_mystic_mirror.1": "I have devised another way to capture some of the lost energy from loose spirits. The Resonant Lens I socketed in is able to focus magic, collecting a little bit of excess energy as I pick up arcana. This energy is then redistributed to the rest of my trinkets, increasing the effect of any that act upon collecting spirits.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_the_narrow_edge.1": "The sweep of the scythe is its main draw. The ability to cut my targets like so much wheat is invaluable.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.primary_arcana.arcane.1": "While other arcana are impulses of the soul, it would be more accurate to say that the arcane is the impulse of the arcana themselves. This $braw arcana/$ lacks any particular quality, simply being undirected spiritual power.",

The impulses that define you are woven into your very self, after all. But lacking an impulse, perhaps this arcana is different. A witch was not born a mage, after all.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.primary_arcana.sacred.1": "Sacred arcana is essential to any magic that enhances life. It can be defined as holy, the energy of particularly vibrant life, or even the simplicity of youth. It is pure and untainted, making it a useful component.",

Negative effects are filtered out, shortening their duration, while positive effects are maintained for longer than normal. Whenever I collect arcana, the ring momentarily works better.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.reactive_trinkets.ring_of_curative_talent.1": "The trinkets documented within cause effects whenever a spirit crystal is collected, feeding off the excess energy.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.reactive_trinkets.ring_of_prowess.1": "Brilliance is attached to the soul, but isn't an impulse like the arcana. It is accumulated knowledge, and so is not inherently tied to the soul that learned it. Even strikes which pass through the soul harmlessly are capable of dislodging it.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.reactive_trinkets.ring_of_prowess.2": "By using condensed Brilliance, I have created a ring that filters out that Brilliance out of arcana I collect, giving me a burst of Brilliant knowledge whenever I collect arcana.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ring_of_esoteric_spoils.1": "It can be tiring, harvesting the sheer quantities of arcana I need for my research. This ring can increase the efficiency of the harvest, allowing me to reap an additional spirit from every slain soul. At a certain point, though, \"efficiency\" ceases to explain it. How am I obtaining more power than the soul itself has?",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood.1": "Runewood is a strange mix of magic and nature, and a fairly common one at that. While pretty, I am more interested in practicality. Runewood is soaked in magic, and as such, can serve as the basis for the arcane.",

The long blade allows time for the body to die before I strike the soul, while also providing a wide sweep attack. It isn't as sharp as a sword, but for my purposes, it will do nicely.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes.2": "What I had managed to do before with careful, painstaking experiments, the scythe did in a matter of seconds. The souls of the monsters I slew shattered, streaming bits of deeply hued matter towards me: the spirit crystals. Finally, my research can begin in earnest.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes.enchanting.1": "At its core, the scythe enchants like other weapons or tools I've used. It has its own set of enchantments, of course, due to its differing nature, but can take Unbreaking and the like as well as a sword can.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes.enchanting.haunted.1": "The Soulstone can be used in ways other than just shattering the soul. By enchanting the stone, the swing of the blade gains a bit of the strange properties of the stone, cutting deeper into the target's soul and doing extra magic damage.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes.enchanting.rebound.1": "By working my enchantments into the wooden handle, I found that my scythe can be made to return to my hand. As strange as it looks, using my scythe as a boomerang can be useful to cut through hordes of monsters. The stronger the enchantment, the less time until I can throw the scythe again.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes.enchanting.spirit_plunder.1": "This is not a perfect method. Some of the soul is unavoidably lost in the moment between blade and stone.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulhunter_gear.1": "Spirit Fabric is an insulator, but that doesn't mean it has to dampen magic. This set of armor is designed to focus that magic, effectively amplifying the user's arcane abilities. Unfortunately, it's not exactly the strongest of materials, and it protects me just about as much as leather clothing.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstained_armor.1": "Much like the Soulstained Scythe, I have improved upon my mundane iron armor to create the Soulstained Armor. To avoid the metal touching me directly, and so jostling and rubbing against my very soul, I used thin plates of Twisted Rock beneath the metal of the armor.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstained_armor.2": "As it exists in both the arcane and physical realms, Soulstained Steel exhibits fascinating defensive properties. It can intercept attacks from both, creating an effect I call Soul Ward. It takes time to restore if the effect is disrupted, but it acts as additional armor which nearly absorbs magic damage completely, and dampens physical damage.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstained_armor.3": "This effect seems similar in nature to others I have studied, such as engraving runes into armor or invoking a black sun upon oneself. Though unlike those, it doesn't $iappear/$ to have a cost. Where is the energy for Soul Ward coming from?",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstained_scythe.1": "The scythe I created to harvest spirits was useful, but ultimately has outlived that usefulness. I have grown fond of the utility it provides, though, and so instead of discarding it I sought to improve it. With Soulstained Steel, I was able to create a more effective weapon and maintain the scythe's advantages.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstone.1": "Sometimes, it appears that matter can be charged with the energies of a soul, despite not having a soul of its own.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstone.2": "This serves as the basis for spirit arcana - the ensouling of the soulless. Soulstone is an ore that exists more in the arcane than the physical, and, refined, presents many uses for my magic. It strongly radiates magic.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood.blight.1": "Another obvious difference is in its effect on the surroundings - namely, the fact that it echoes the Undirected Rite with the energies of its growth, transmuting the world around it into blight. I ought to create a safely contained area if I wish to grow these trees.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood.bonemeal.1": "Much like blight, the sapling accepts both spirit arcana and common fertilizers such as bonemeal. The end result is roughly the same across both options.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood.color.1": "The most obvious differences with the tree itself are shape and leaf color. Soulwood is more spindly than Runewood, and its leaves are a sickly purple hue instead of a rich orange-yellow. It can still be used for many of the same things, though.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood.intro.1": "After further study, I have discovered that the Soulwood produced by the Unchained Rite is actually an entirely different species from the Runewood it is made from. It grows differently, it acts differently... it appears the spiritual scars that created it go deeper than just its color and magic.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood.sap.1": "The sticky lifeblood of the tree also seems to well up much more often in a tree than in Runewood. The sap's effects are corrupted as well; rather than restoring my vigor, Unholy Syrup enhances it, increasing my attack strength.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_crystals.1": "The soul is a notoriously fickle thing. Even confirming its existence is difficult, requiring the highest thaumaturgies to get a reading. That is what sets spirit arcana apart from other magic. We don't need grand assemblies and esoteric artifice to see a soul. Simply destroying it is proof enough.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_crystals.2": "A material I have named Soulstone is the means by which we do so. It appears mundane until refined, but once it is rid of impurities, it seems... out of phase with the world. By creating a blade using it as a core, I should be able to strike not only the physical form, but also the soul, shattering it to energy before it can disperse.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_crystals.3": "These energies, as previously noted, have different 'frequencies' of sorts. A being burning with light would have a soul that reflects that radiance, and a being prone to adaptation would have a soul as malleable as itself. Occasionally, the energy has no flavor to it at all, leaving only the raw impulse of creation behind. That type of crystal bears further study.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_fabric.1": "Spirit Fabric is a light yet sturdy material that acts as an insulator for spirit energies. While other materials have the same properties, it's not exactly practical to craft a pouch or clothing from stone. I'm not willing to go quite so far for my research as to try wearing something like $ithat/$.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_fabric.pouch.1": "But this fabric works wonderfully for storing spirit crystals. It keeps the arcana condensed within, and will even store spirits I pick up before they so much as clutter my pockets. It can store as many spirits as a single chest, making it quite convenient to carry around.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_focusing.1": "Using the opposing polarities of Twisted and Tainted Rock, I have created a device that draws in and focuses arcane energy. If given a compatible substrate, I can use this process to create things.",

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion.1": "By using Runewood's natural magic as a base, I have designed the altar that will serve as the basis for my magecraft - the Spirit Altar. It is the other piece of the equation, the use for the arcana. By infusing them into items, and using the energies to effect other fusions, I can begin to explore this.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion.2": "To use the altar, I must lay the item I wish to infuse on top of it, along with an appropriate set of arcana. If I wish to fuse other items in the process, I must place them on some form of Runewood item holder. They must be within four blocks of the altar to work.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion.3": "Once all the arcana are present, the power within the crystals will begin to flow into the central item. If other items are fused in, they are pulled in during this process. When all of that is done, the product of the infusion will appear. It $iis/$ rather slow, though...",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion.hex_ash.1": "My first product with this process is a powder I call Hex Ash, after its color. It is a simple and useful grit, with the niter and sulfur mostly transmuted by the raw arcana, leaving a mixture of reagent and carbon.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.hallowed_gold.1": "Gold is often used as a thaumaturgical base, its natural conductivity of magic making it quite useful. Spirit arcana are no exception. In fact, using Sacred arcana, we can enhance those properties.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.hallowed_gold.2": "Hallowed Gold, as a metal, acts much like its mundane counterpart. The inherent innocence of the arcana infused into the alloy makes other arcana glide through it smoothly, creating the perfect conductor for my purposes.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.hallowed_gold.spirit_jar.1": "A simple application of this metal is the Spirit Jar. As spirits in their raw form don't have mass, by trapping them under Hallowed Gold you can store far more than you could physically. The capacity of these jars is near-infinite, though each only stores one type of spirit.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.soulstained_steel.1": "Iron is mundane, in a word. By using Hex Ash as my source of carbon, and attuning the metal with Soulstone, I can create a metal that is $isimultaneously/$ in and out of phase with the world.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.soulstained_steel.2": "Anything made from Soulstained Steel is capable of striking the soul, without the need for specifics of engineering like with my crude scythe. Wearing the metal in its base form as armor is dangerous, as it will touch your own soul as well, so I must engineer a countermeasure.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_stones.tainted_rock.1": "Stone is reluctant to change, but nothing can endure the power of an unchained soul forever. By using raw arcana to force that change, I have created stones with useful magical properties. With Sacred arcana as the catalyst, it forms Tainted Rock, a stone that dissipates magic nearby.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_stones.twisted_rock.1": "With Wicked arcana's nature as the opposite of Sacred, it follows that the stone produced with it would act opposite. Twisted Rock has most of the same properties as Tainted Rock, but pushes magic away from it instead of dissipating it. Both can be fashioned into item holders, as Runewood can.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_trinkets.1": "Many disciplines of magic, and even more mundane practices, allow the creation of useful trinkets. These are also referred to as baubles or curios by some. The metals I have alloyed have properties useful in their own rights, and can be used as the basis for even grander designs.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_trinkets.2": "In their most basic form, Hallowed Gold trinkets protect the user as if they were wearing weak armor, and Soulstained Steel trinkets increase the toughness of the armor being worn.",

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic.2": "To begin with Totem Magic, I may engrave spirit arcana into Runewood Logs, forming a rune representing the magic. If unwanted, engraved spirits can be stripped off with an axe, but I have uses in mind. With a Runewood Totem Base, and then a specific set of runes in a totem pole placed above my totem base, I can perform a Spirit Rite.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic.3": "While each rite does offer a unique function, they follow patterns and categorize easily. For what I term \"aura rites\", they are simple, effect-providing rites that affect anything living within eight blocks of the base. For other rituals which alter beings, most affect anything within half the range of an aura rite.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic.4": "For those which alter blocks, most affect the five-by-five area on the level beneath the base, towards where the runes are facing. These rituals can also be made more selective with the use of Item Stands. By placing them on the sides of the rune pillars, you can make the ritual only recognize and alter the types of blocks lying on the stands.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic.5": "One caveat is that no rite's totem may function within the range of another, identical ritual. If you try, the first one will simply fizzle out, the energies coursing through it disrupted.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.transmutation.intro.1": "The unchained rite is used to change the nature of the mundane, and upon further study, this doesn't appear to be limited to just Souldwood. After countless hours spent trying to discover all the secrets the Rite holds, I've come to document just three transmutation trees of sorts.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.transmutation.intro.2": "An Unchained Transmutation revolves around using the chaotic ritual to change matter, depending on which material we start with, the Rite will shift any given block forward in the tree, turning it into blight at the very end of it. There doesn't appear to be any reason for ",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.tyrving.1": "The Tyrving is a rather esoteric blade. It's strange design makes it appear as a weak weapon not suited for combat. However, it's hex ash lining and twisted rock form cause it to deal extra magic damage to the soul, the greater the soul the more benefit.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.tyrving.2": "The weapon can also be repaired using arcane restoration quite efficiently.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.voodoo_magic.1": "The future holds many secrets..",
