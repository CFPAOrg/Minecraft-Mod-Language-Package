The first thing suggested to do is to use the two buttons in the upper right to input the recipes, which allows you to create and edit recipes. All of the calculations require recipes to be recorded.\fTo calculate the cost of an item, simply pick the item from JEIs item list then put it in the slot in the upper left of the interface with all of the recipes to use recorded. The result will then be displayed in the lower slots of the interface. The four buttons provide options to display input, output, catalyst and crafting steps.\fThe button in the upper left allows you to edit and get a label. Labels are a very important part of the mod. They are basically things that can be put into a slot, including ItemStack, FluidStack, OreDict entry, or simply a placeholder. Lables are used in the calculation process. Most of time they are quite clever as long as you configure them properly.",
