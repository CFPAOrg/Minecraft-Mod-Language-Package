# Stockpile Switch
![Now to switch it up!](block:create:stockpile_switch)

The serial port module is capable of interacting with a Stockpile Switch to report the fill level of an attached inventory. A read operation will return the fill level of the attached container as an integer percentage in the range [0,100]. This interface does not support write operations.
