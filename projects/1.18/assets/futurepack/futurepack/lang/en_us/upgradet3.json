  "According to the laws of physics of this world, I can extract some of my knowledge with the help of - for lack of a better word - a magic wand. I can then bind this knowledge to objects.",
  "Perhaps I can use this strange process to create things more useful than just glittery tools. My current technology has so much potential for improvement with this.",
  "I have developed a research module based on the Enchanting Table, which allows me to extract my knowledge of the world in the form of experience points (XP) and, if necessary, inject it again.",
  "The module must be linked directly to the Researcher or via a network to function. The actual work takes place in the Researcher as normal.",

  "The module stores up to 1500 XP (about 31 levels). If this proves insufficient, I can simply connect several modules to a Researcher.",
  "However, I should also connect more calculation modules to the researcher. Currently, 8-16 modules are expected to be adequate."
