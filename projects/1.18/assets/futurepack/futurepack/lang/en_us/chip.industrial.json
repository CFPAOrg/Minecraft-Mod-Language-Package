	"I have developed a special chipset that is able to improve the efficiency of machines.",
	"This chipset is most useful in energy generators, where it can affect the generation and/or transformation of energy. The industrial chipset can increase energy production per tick or the profit from resources.",

	"A industrial chipset of high quality (high chip power) will work better than one of lower quality. The usage of multiple chipsets can combine the effect.",
	"Hint: The exact effect varies and is determined by the machine in which it is installed.",
	"Hint: Refer to \"Logic Chipset\" for general information on chipsets."
