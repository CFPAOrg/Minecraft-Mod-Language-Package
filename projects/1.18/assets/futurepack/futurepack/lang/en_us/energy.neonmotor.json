	"I discovered a form of energy that fundamentally differs from mine and that of the Unreachable. This unfamiliar form of energy is called Redstone Flux and uses an unstable form of Redstone. Therefore I tried to develop a converter.",
	"It is based off a kind of motor which converts Neon energy into the lesser form of energy. To me it seems unpredictable and dangerous, so I don't really trust this technology.",
	"But who knows, maybe sometime I'll be forced to use this technology.",

    "For easy handling, I constructed the Neon motor so that it can be powered by Redstone. Additionally it needs some time to heat up, the production of RF scales in accordance to the temperature."
