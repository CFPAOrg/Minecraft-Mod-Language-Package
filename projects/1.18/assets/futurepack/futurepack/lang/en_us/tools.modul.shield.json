    "The protective value of the armor is high, but as I have now energy modules I though of possibilities to further improve it.",
    "I discovered a rare case where every substance can act as a ferrofluid but only for a small amount of time. To controll it I have used quantanium coils as they can create strong magnetic fields due to their low electrical resistence.",
    "I dont understand the process compleatly but when a spark hits bitripentium the atoms around start to lose their eletron pairs resulting of short time magnetism of all atoms around, combined with the strong magnetic field of the coils everything is a shortime ferrofluid.",
    "In theorie only energy is needed and this device would turn my very body into a ferrofluid, but because of unknown side effects the armor is used as a shield to lower the effect of my own body.",

    "Currently one shield is enough to protect a tens of my life but needs one second to regenerate. This will do not much against large amounts of damage but it will help against small amounts."
