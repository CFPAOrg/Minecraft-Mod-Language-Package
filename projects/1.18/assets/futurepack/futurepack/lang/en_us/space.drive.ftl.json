  "According to my calculations, I would need to fly a very long time to reach another planet, because my flight speeds are limited. So I searched for other possibilities to move through space. With the teleportation power of ender pearls in mind, I created a new drive, which manipulates the folds of space itself to create a shortcut to a destination.",
  "This process needs a lot of power and is only possible with a special machine I named the FTL-Drive. It is built with 12 FTL-Blocks, a 2x3 foundation and 2 blocks tall. After all 12 components are placed, I can assemble the final drive. (This connects automatically.)",
  "I have to install this drive in any spaceship I use if I wish to ever fly further than Menelaus.",
