	"I've discovered an alloy with very interesting properties, called Wakurium. This material can transmit energy pulses very quickly.",
	"This allows me to transfer any form of information quickly and with no fear of data loss. Many potential applications exist for such a technology.",
	"The researcher, scanner and the modules can all be connected via the network and therefore don't have to be located in the same location anymore. This enables me to build large storage rooms while still being able to connect them all with the researcher.",
	"I am now able to attach more Calculation-Modules to the researcher, by using the network. Additionally I should improve them with better components. Currently, 2-4 Modules should be appropriate.",
	"Also I developed the concept for a Shared Researcher, which transmits all my new findings to all other Shared Researchers of the same network. So I am able to share my knowledge automaticcaly and free with ohter players.",
