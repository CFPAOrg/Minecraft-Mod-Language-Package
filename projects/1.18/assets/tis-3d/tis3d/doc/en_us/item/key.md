# Key
![Any skeletons around?](item:tis3d:key)

The key is available for most [casing](../block/casing.md) series and provides a convenient way of locking configurations to prevent accidental or malicious interactions with a [casing](../block/casing.md) and the modules installed in it.

Keys contain an advanced imprinting mechanism, producing a unique signature for each key.

[Casings](../block/casing.md) locked with a key provide reduced access: modules cannot be removed or installed, and most modules will no longer allow changes to their configuration. Specifically, among the common mainline modules, the [execution module](execution_module.md) will no longer accept new programming. However, the [keypad module](keypad_module.md) will still allow user input.

Take good care of a key once it was used to lock a [casing](../block/casing.md). If lost, the only way to unlock a [casing](../block/casing.md) is to break and rebuild it.

While sneaking, keys can also be used to close/open individual receiving ports on a [casing's](../block/casing.md) face. See the manual entry on [casings](../block/casing.md) for more information.
