# ROM Module
![ROM will remember that.](item:tis3d:read_only_memory_module)

The read-only memory module (ROM module) is very similar to the [RAM module](random_access_memory_module.md), in that it stores 256 8-bit values for later retrieval. Access to the stored values works the same way as with the [RAM module](random_access_memory_module.md).

However, the ROM module *cannot* be written to from another module. To program a ROM module, hold it in your hand and use it on an installed [RAM module](random_access_memory_module.md). The current state of the [RAM module](random_access_memory_module.md) will then be stored in the ROM module for later retrieval. Alternatively, use a ROM module while holding it in your hand to manipulate stored values manually. Very, very carefully.

This can be quite useful for initializing a TIS-3D system automatically, and for the creative can open the way for much larger and complex programs.
