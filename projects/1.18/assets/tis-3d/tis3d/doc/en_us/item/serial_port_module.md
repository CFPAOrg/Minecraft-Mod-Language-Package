# Serial Port Module
![Serialize it](item:tis3d:serial_port_module)

The serial port module provides a common interface for other machines to interact with. The actual serial protocol used varies by machine and is defined by the machine's manufacturer. For a full list of registered protocols, please refer to [Serial Protocols](../protocols/index.md).

Whether the serial port module reads or writes on its ports depends on the implementation of the serial protocol provided by the device in front of the serial port module, again, please refer to the documentation of the individual protocols for further information.
