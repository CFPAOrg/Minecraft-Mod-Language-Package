The top texture of the tug dock must be aligned with the barge docks, forming a continuous line of docks. The docks do not transfer things themselves but communicate to the tug when whether there is stuff to transfer and it needs to wait. Alternatively, the tug can be forced to wait by applying a redstone signal."
