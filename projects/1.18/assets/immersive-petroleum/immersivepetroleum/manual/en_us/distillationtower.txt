Distillation Tower
Environmentally unfriendly
<&distillationtower0>The Distillation Tower is a large multiblock structure that separates crude oil into a number of byproducts.<np>
It is built as shown and formed by using the Engineering's Hammer on the Redstone Engineering Block.

Applying a redstone signal to the control panel will halt the machine's process, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Screwdriver.

Crude Oil can be input into the Distillation Tower at the back hatch marked with a blue dot, where it will be heated until it separates into a number of layers. This produces a variety of fluids and has a chance to produce Bitumen as a byproduct.

Consuming <config;i;distillationtower_operationcost>IF/t, it converts:
50mB/t of Crude Oil to:
|   15mB/t of Naphtha
|   18mB/t of Kerosene
|   30mB/t Sulfurized Diesel
|   12mB/t Lubricant
|   and some Bitumen.

The produced fluid mix is output from the side hatch marked with an orange dot; the Bitumen through the front hatch.

10mB/t of Cracked Naphtha to:
|   6mB/t Ethylene
|   2mB/t Propylene
|   2mB/t Benzene

12mB/t of Cracked Lubricant to:
|   6mB/t Kerosene
|   10mB/t Sulfurized Diesel

10mB/t of Kerosene to:
|   2mB/t Naphtha
|   3mB/t Gasoline Additives
|   5mB/t Sulfurized Diesel

Diesel can be used for <link;diesel_generator;§o§npower §o§nproduction§r>; Lubricant for <link;immersivepetroleum:lubricant;§o§noiling §o§nmachines§r>; Kerosene for <link;diesel_generator;§o§npower §o§nproduction§r>; and Naphtha for <link;immersivepetroleum:portablegenerator;§o§npowering §o§nengines§r> or <link;immersivepetroleum:plastics;§o§nplastics§r>. Bitumen is used to make <link;immersivepetroleum:asphalt;§o§nAsphalt§r> and can be processed to get Petroleum Coke in the <link;immersivepetroleum:cokerunit;§o§nCoker§r>.
