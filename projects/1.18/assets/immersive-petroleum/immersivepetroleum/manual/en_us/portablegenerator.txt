Portable Generator
Gassed up
<&portablegenerator0>The Portable Generator is a mobile all-in-one power solution. This <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§olight fuel§r;gasoline>-fueled engine-generator produces up to <config;i;portablegenerator_flux> Flux/t while running, and has an internal power buffer of 100,000 RF.<np>
The Portable Generator can accept fuel by simply right clicking with a bucket. Gasoline or other light fuel (<link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oNaphtha, Benzene§r;naphtha>) can also be piped in from above. Power is output directly through LV or MV wires, Connectors are not needed. Applying a redstone signal will halt generation.

Sneaking and right clicking on the generator will pick it up, preserving all stored power and fuel.
