Petroleum Products
At Least It's Not GT5u
<&crude>
Crude Oil is a sticky, black substance that seeps from <link;immersivepetroleum:reservoir;§n§oreservoirs§r> in the world. It is the base resource that all other petroleum-based resources take their feedstock from, and is essential to any petrochemical engineer's journey.

Crude oil can be separated in the <link;immersivepetroleum:distillationtower;§n§oDistillation Tower§r> once it is extracted from reservoirs.
<&lubricant>
Lubricant is the heaviest fraction immediately distillable from <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oCrude Oil§r;crude>, and is best used to lubricate machines to high efficiency. It can be processed into <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oParaffin Wax§r;paraffin>

It can be burned in the flare stack or cracked into <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oDiesel§r;diesel> and <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oKerosene§r;kerosene> if such activities are not useful.
<&diesel>
Diesel and Sulfurized Diesel are the heavyweight fuels of the petrochemical engineer, being able to be used in the <link;immersiveengineering:diesel_generator;§n§oDiesel Generator§r> for bulk power production.

Sulfurized Diesel can be used for an easy source of sulfur, and is the second-heaviest fraction distillable from <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oCrude Oil§r;crude>.
<&kerosene>
Kerosene is a medium fuel usable in the <link;immersiveengineering:diesel_generator;§n§oDiesel Generator§r> for bulk power production. It can be separated into its light, medium, and heavy fractions to upgrade <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oNaphtha§r;naphtha> into <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oGasoline§r;gasoline>.

Being a lighter fraction than <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oDiesel§r;diesel>, kerosene does not accumulate as much sulfur and does not need to be desulfurized.
<&naphtha>
Naphtha is a volatile light fuel usable in <link;immersivepetroleum:portablegenerator;§n§oPortable Generators§r> or <link;immersivepetroleum:speedboat;§n§oMotorboat§r>, and the lightest fraction in <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oCrude Oil§r;crude>.

Its volatility can be controlled via <link;immersiveengineering:refinery;§n§omixing§r> it with gasoline additives to form <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oGasoline§r;gasoline>.

Naphtha is chemical feedstock for producing plastics, and is often used to produce <link;immersiveengineering:plastic;§n§oPhenolic Resin§r> from its <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oderivates§r;naphtha_derivates>.
<&naphtha_derivates>
Benzene, Propylene, and Ethylene are not immediately distillable from crude oil, these lighter feedstocks must be distilled from <link;immersivepetroleum:plastics;§n§ocracked naphtha§r;plastics1>.

Benzene can be used as light fuel, but propylene and ethylene are gasses, and cannot. All three are used as chemical feedstock for <link;immersiveengineering:plastic;§n§oPhenolic Resin§r>.
<&gasoline>
Gasoline is a light fuel suitable for the <link;immersivepetroleum:portablegenerator;§n§oPortable Generator§r> or <link;immersivepetroleum:speedboat;§n§oMotorboat§r>, and can also be used in <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oNapalm§r;napalm>.

Gasoline is a mixed, high quality fuel made from <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oKerosene§r;kerosene> and <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oNaphtha§r;naphtha>, with reduced volatility and a higher efficiency in the <link;immersivepetroleum:portablegenerator;§n§oPortable Generator§r>.
<&napalm>
Napalm is an extremely flammable substance that can be created in the <link;mixer;§n§oMixer§r> using <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oGasoline§r;gasoline> and three measures of Aluminium Grit. It has little use other than wanton destruction; when Napalm is lit, fire will spread almost immediately over its surface, allowing for rapid deforestation. In addition, it can serve as a very effective fuel for the <link;chemthrower;§n§oChemthrower§r>.
<&paraffin>
Paraffin wax is a waxy solid that can be used as an artificial beeswax substitute, making candles or waxing copper to stop it from oxidizing.

Paraffin Wax is created from the dewaxing at high pressure of <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oLubricant§r;lubricant> at a slow rate.
