Oil Tank
Bathtub for Gentlemen
<&oiltank0>
The Oil Tank is a self-levelling multiblock tank bigger than the normal <link;tank;§o§nFluid Tank§r>, with both side, top, and bottom fluid ports. It can store 1024B of any non-gaseous fluid.<np>
The Oil Tank will self-level with any non-configured Oil Tanks next to it within a line, so a line of them will all level to the same percentage full.

The side fluid ports can be configured with the hammer, while the top and bottom ports cannot. Both the top and bottom port can input, but only the bottom fluid port can output.

Because of its generous capacity, the tank is a good fit for use with the <link;immersivepetroleum:derrick;§o§nDerrick§r>, to handle the high production.

Attaching a comparator to the redstone port of the tank will read the fill of the full tank in a 0-15 metric. Attaching the comparator to one of the layers results in a signal proportional to the height of the comparator. For example, a comparator attached to the second layer of a tank would not emit any signal until the tank is 1/4 full and have a signal strength of 15 if the tank is half full or more.
