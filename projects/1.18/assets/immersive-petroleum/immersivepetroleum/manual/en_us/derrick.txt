Derrick
OSHA Nightmare
<&derrick0>
The Oil Derrick is a large multiblock structure that drills beneath the bedrock to recover fluid from <link;immersivepetroleum:reservoir;§o§nfluid reservoirs§r>.<np>
It is built as shown and formed by using the Engineering's Hammer on the Light Engineering Block.

Applying a redstone signal to the control panel will halt the machine's process, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Screwdriver.

The derrick opens up reservoirs for oil extraction before the <link;immersivepetroleum:pumpjack;§o§nPumpjack§r> can be used to finish off extracting oil from them. <np>
The derrick cannot work below the waterline as backpressure from groundwater interferes with well construction.

First, the derrick drills down to bedrock, and places encased concrete fluid pipes, consuming <link;immersiveengineering:mixer;§o§nliquid concrete§r> to do so.

Once the derrick has hit bedrock, it begins drilling through the bedrock to a target location that can be set via its interface, consuming water and fluid pipes to do so. <np>
When the well has been dug, fluid pressure from the reservoir is to be positive - fluid is forced out of the derrick and into, depending on space, the derrick tank and out to external storage such as the <link;immersivepetroleum:oiltank;§o§nOil Tank§r>. If the derrick has no ability to output, it will waste and gush fluid out of the top.

Once the positive pressure in the reservoir has dropped to zero, the derrick is no longer needed, and fluid extraction can be moved to a <link;immersivepetroleum:pumpjack;§o§nPumpjack§r>.
