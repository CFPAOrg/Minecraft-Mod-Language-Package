Petroleum Plastics
Does Not Contain 2,3,7,8-TCDD!

<link;immersiveengineering:plastic;§n§oPhenolic Resin§r> is a chemical marvel for the modern age, but one crucial thing is lacking: it had no petroleum-derived process for its production.

Using newly developed thermal cracking systems, this is no longer: phenolic resin can be produced from <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oNaphtha§r;naphtha> feedstock using a combination of high temperature techniques to crack it into its constituent alkenes.
<&plastics1>
Cracked Naphtha is produced in the <link;immersivepetroleum:hydrotreater;§n§oHigh-Pressure Refinery Unit§r>, converting 20mB Naphtha and 5mB of Water to 20mB of Cracked Naphtha.

Cracked Naphtha can then be <link;immersivepetroleum:distillationtower;§n§odistilled§r> into Benzene, Propylene, and Ethylene; the three alkenes produce portions of the chemical process for <link;immersiveengineering:plastic;§n§oPhenolic Resin§r>.

Benzene is a liquid alkene, and can be combined in the <link;immersiveengineering:refinery;§n§oRefinery§r> with Propylene for Phenol, more commonly known as <link;cokeoven;Creosote Oil;outputs>.

Ethylene is a gaseous alkene that oxidizable to Acetaldehyde. This process is done using §2Copper Plate§r as catalyst.

These two chemical feedstocks are used to produce the polymer resin of <link;immersiveengineering:plastic;§n§oDuroplast§r;duroplast_sheet>.
