  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction.3": "The energies this thaumaturgical discipline manipulates seem to be rooted in the soul. More accurately, they are the energies of the soul, the inclinations and impulses that make up each one of us.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction.4": "So far, what I have described is basic. But I have found a way to separate, and then condense, the impulse of a soul into a physical form I call a spirit crystal. This forms the basis of my research.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction.5": "The natures of the soul I condense influence the crystal's properties. Each soul is slightly different, and that can result in changes to the crystals formed. I believe these spirit crystals to be just the breakthrough I need.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.managing_totems.1": "Totem rites are both complicated and simple, in their own ways. A simple, bounded effect, but dependent on the flow of arcana - and it can be difficult to discern their range.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.managing_totems.2": "I have created a staff to act as a tuning fork of sorts for the energies of rites. Simply holding it resonates with the flow of arcana through the world, allowing me to visualize the area each totem can affect.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.managing_totems.3": "Interestingly, the staff also allows me to 'tune' a rune into an active state by interacting with it, even if it's not on a totem. This is as far as I can tell purely visual, but if nothing else, it will make good decoration.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.mending_diffuser.1": "By using Living Flesh to sympathize with natural healing, the Mending Diffuser will, upon the Crucible completing a focusing cycle, potentially repair any impetus by a small amount. It cannot mend an already cracked impetus.",

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.mote_making.1": "Arcana crystals emit their own strange glow. Why not tune that to be stronger? The tool I use to do this is the Lamplighter's Tongs; simply hold them in one hand and the crystal in another to create a 'mote'.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.mote_making.2": "These Motes are concentrations of pure arcane energy, with a thin shell of warding magic to keep it from spilling. This has little magical implication, but the resulting lights are pretty.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.natural_quartz.1": "Natural Quartz is, as the name implies, a natural equivalent of the nether resource. It's used for most of the same things. It's rare, and found deep underground, sometimes in geodes.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_blissful_harmony.1": "To focus on my magics I more often than not need peace and clarity. As such, I have devised a tool to redirect attention around me. While worn, this accessory will hide my presence from nearby adversaries, decreasing their likelihood of taking interest in me.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_blissful_harmony.2": "Upon further studies, it would appear that the effects of my newly forged trinket are $iespecially/$ potent when exerting their influence over any soul bearing a Wicked spirit.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_the_mystic_mirror.1": "I have devised another way to capture some of the lost energy from loose spirits. The Resonant Lens I socketed in is able to focus magic, collecting a little bit of excess energy as I pick up arcana. This energy is then redistributed to the rest of my trinkets, increasing the effect of any that act upon collecting spirits.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_the_narrow_edge.1": "The sweep of the scythe is its main draw. The ability to cut my targets like so much wheat is invaluable. But that comes at the cost of damage to a single target. This necklace mystically focuses the edge of my attack, directing all of the power into one target for a strong damage boost.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.primary_arcana.arcane.1": "While other arcana are impulses of the soul, it would be more accurate to say that the arcane is the impulse of the arcana themselves. This $braw arcana/$ lacks any particular quality, simply being undirected spiritual power.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.primary_arcana.arcane.2": "It is the impulse of creation, the first principle of all things. It is found within those who have opened their soul to power, or whose origins lie in that power.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.primary_arcana.arcane.3": "I suspect that this arcana, unlike others, can join a soul over time. Most things about the soul are defined early on. The impulses that define you are woven into your very self, after all. But lacking an impulse, perhaps this arcana is different. A witch was not born a mage, after all.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.primary_arcana.sacred.1": "Sacred arcana is essential to any magic that enhances life. It can be defined as holy, the energy of particularly vibrant life, or even the simplicity of youth. It is pure and untainted, making it a useful component.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.primary_arcana.sacred.2": "It is the impulse of purity, the desire for optimism. It is found in those who are passive, innocent, or holy in origin.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.primary_arcana.wicked.1": "Wicked arcana is inimical to life. It seeks death and despair, and warps the living into something else. Even touching the crystal makes my soul shudder in pain.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.primary_arcana.wicked.2": "It is the impulse of corruption, the desire to cause suffering. It is found in those whose souls lack life, or those twisted by malice.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.prismatic_focus_lens.1": "Sometimes, simplicity is the best goal. The Prismatic Focus Lens bends not light, but the flow of arcana, reducing instability of the spirit focusing process. It is important to note, stability can only prevent the impetus from suffering $iadditional/$ damage.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.reactive_trinkets.ring_of_alchemical_mastery.1": "This ring, through alchemical trickery, is able to manipulate the potions running through my blood.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.reactive_trinkets.ring_of_prowess.1": "Brilliance is attached to the soul, but isn't an impulse like the arcana.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.reactive_trinkets.ring_of_prowess.2": "By using condensed Brilliance, I have created a ring that filters out that Brilliance out of arcana I collect, giving me a burst of Brilliant knowledge whenever I collect arcana.",

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.rune_of_volatile_distortion.1": "The Rune of Volatile Distortion, rather than imploring the mind, corrupts its actions with random chance, making the user's attacks erratic in damage - anywhere from nine tenths as powerful to twelve tenths. Sometimes, this randomness aligns with weaknesses by chance, doubling the strength of the attack.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.rune_of_warding.1": "The Rune of Warding conveys the Rite of Warding, granting Gaia's Bulwark to its wearer at a reduced potency, effectively granting armor.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood.1": "Runewood is a strange mix of magic and nature, and a fairly common one at that. While pretty, I am more interested in practicality. Runewood is soaked in magic, and as such, can serve as the basis for the arcane.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood.2": "The tree is predominantly found within large open plains, however it can also be found in forests. The tree can be best identified by it's leaves, proudly displaying an orange-yellow palette.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood.arcane_charcoal.1": "Runewood's charcoal, as magic-infused as it is, burns with an arcane fervor for longer than regular charcoal. This makes it rather useful for fueling any smelting I need to do.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood.runic_sap.1": "Runewood trees tend to have a buildup of sticky sap on the sides of their logs. When this happens, if you strip off the bark, you'll be able to bottle the sap, which makes for a rejuvenating drink.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood.runic_sap.2": "The sap can also be used to create sapballs, able to be used interchangeably with slimeballs for most recipes. Runic sap can also be turned into a block form, which is rather sticky.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runeworking.1": "Every trinket I've made thus far has proven to have its place in my work, but it has become somewhat frustrating to have to spend time choosing out my jewelery before every task. After all, some effects may be able to be divorced from their genesis.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runeworking.2": "The process of Runeworking allows me to do so via Brooches and Runes. The brooch is simply the focus I have chosen, its placement over the heart symbolizing the price of suffering inherent to runic power.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runeworking.3": "To begin, I will need to create a Runic Workbench to inscribe these runes. The simplest beginning will be the Runic Brooch, which will allow me to equip what I have created.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runic_brooch.1": "The simplest of brooches is the Runic Brooch. It represents the quest for power at price, and the bloodied palms with which one grasps a razored enlightenment. When worn, by symbolically removing one of my hands' capacity to channel magic from a ring, it will grant me the opportunity to inscribe a rune in each palm.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.sacred_rite": "A simple rite, while active it will slowly mend the wounds of nearby entities.\n Avoids hostiles.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.sacred_rite.hover": "Recovers one heart of damage every two seconds.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes.1": "After several inert attempts, I have socketed Soulstone into a weapon that can reliably harvest these spirit crystals. The long blade allows time for the body to die before I strike the soul, while also providing a wide sweep attack. It isn't as sharp as a sword, but for my purposes, it will do nicely.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes.2": "What I had managed to do before with careful, painstaking experiments, the scythe did in a matter of seconds. The souls of the monsters I slew shattered, streaming bits of deeply hued matter towards me: the spirit crystals. Finally, my research can begin in earnest.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes.enchanting.1": "At its core, the scythe enchants like other weapons or tools I've used. It has its own set of enchantments, of course, due to its differing nature, but can take Unbreaking and the like as well as a sword can.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes.enchanting.animated.1": "If power can be concentrated, it can be diffused. Interestingly, by diffusing the power that would be drawn together for Haunted into the rest of the scythe, the entire weapon gains a conceptual \"lightness\", making its swings lighter and faster.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes.enchanting.ascension.1": "A fascinating bit of symbolism is the role of the tool in raising man up. Civilization was built by the food a scythe harvests. By harnessing the purpose of the blade as a tool, I can… well, raise myself, the winds I rise on sharp as the blade itself to my foes. Rebound is incompatible; literally, at cross purposes with this enchantment.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes.enchanting.haunted.1": "Soulstone interacts with souls, obviously. The crudest and simplest use is blunt force, shattering a soul like a pane of glass. If I condense the arcane power of the stone, it would therefore hit and shatter harder, perhaps even damaging the body with the backlash.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes.enchanting.rebound.1": "A scythe reaps. That is its purpose, and that can be harnessed. Should a reaper need my hand? By harnessing the purpose of the blade as a weapon, I can let it act on its own to some extent, as if it were a boomerang. The stronger the enchantment, the sooner it’s ready to throw again.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes.enchanting.spirit_plunder.1": "This is not a perfect method. Some of the soul is unavoidably lost in the moment between blade and stone. But by enchanting the blade, that loss can be mitigated, and more of the soul condensed. This unfortunately strains the stone, and can result in my scythe's durability decreasing.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.shielding_apparatus.1": "By utilizing the multiphasic property of Soulstained Steel, the Shielding Apparatus provides a chance for the damage imposed upon the impetus to be $icompletely/$ absorbed, while also slightly stabilizing the focusing process. It does, however, reduce focusing speed.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulhunter_gear.1": "Spirit Fabric is an insulator, but that doesn't mean it has to dampen magic. This set of armor is designed to focus that magic, effectively amplifying the user's arcane abilities. Unfortunately, it's not exactly the strongest of materials, and it protects me just about as much as leather clothing.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstained_armor.1": "Much like the Soulstained Scythe, I have improved upon my mundane iron armor to create the Soulstained Armor. To avoid the metal touching me directly, and so jostling and rubbing against my very soul, I used thin plates of Twisted Rock beneath the metal of the armor.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstained_armor.2": "As it exists in both the arcane and physical realms, Soulstained Steel exhibits fascinating defensive properties. It can intercept attacks from both, creating an effect I call Soul Ward. It takes time to restore if the effect is disrupted, but it acts as additional armor which nearly absorbs magic damage completely, and dampens physical damage.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstained_armor.3": "This effect seems similar in nature to others I have studied, such as engraving runes into armor or invoking a black sun upon oneself. Though unlike those, it doesn't $iappear/$ to have a cost. Where is the energy for Soul Ward coming from?",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstained_scythe.1": "The scythe I created to harvest spirits was useful, but ultimately has outlived that usefulness. I have grown fond of the utility it provides, though, and so instead of discarding it I sought to improve it. With Soulstained Steel, I was able to create a more effective weapon and maintain the scythe's advantages.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstone.1": "Sometimes, it appears that matter can be charged with the energies of a soul, despite not having a soul of its own.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstone.2": "This serves as the basis for spirit arcana - the ensouling of the soulless. Soulstone is an ore that exists more in the arcane than the physical, and, refined, presents many uses for my magic. It strongly radiates magic.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood.blight.1": "Another obvious difference is in its effect on the surroundings - namely, the fact that it echoes the Undirected Rite with the energies of its growth, transmuting the world around it into blight. I ought to create a safely contained area if I wish to grow these trees.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood.bonemeal.1": "Much like blight, the sapling accepts both spirit arcana and common fertilizers such as bonemeal. The end result is roughly the same across both options.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood.color.1": "The most obvious differences with the tree itself are shape and leaf color. Soulwood is more spindly than Runewood, and its leaves are a sickly purple-red hue instead of a rich orange-yellow. It can still be used for many of the same things, though.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood.intro.1": "After further study, I have discovered that the Soulwood produced by the Unchained Rite has actually become an entirely different species from the Runewood it is made from. It grows differently, it acts differently... it appears the spiritual scars that created it go deeper than just its color and magic.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood.sap.1": "The sticky lifeblood of the tree also seems to well up much more often in a tree than in Runewood. The sap's effects are corrupted as well; rather than restoring my vigor, Unholy Syrup enhances it, increasing my attack strength and providing damage resistance.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_crystals.1": "The soul is a notoriously fickle thing. Even confirming its existence is difficult, requiring the highest thaumaturgies to get a reading. That is what sets spirit arcana apart from other magic. We don't need grand assemblies and esoteric artifice to see a soul. Simply destroying it is proof enough.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_crystals.2": "A material I have named Soulstone is the means by which we do so. It appears mundane until refined, but once it is rid of impurities, it seems... out of phase with the world. By creating a blade using it as a core, I should be able to strike not only the physical form, but also the soul, shattering it to energy before it can disperse.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_crystals.3": "These energies, as previously noted, have different 'frequencies' of sorts. A being burning with light would have a soul that reflects that radiance, and a being prone to adaptation would have a soul as malleable as itself. Occasionally, the energy has no flavor to it at all, leaving only the raw impulse of creation behind. That type of crystal bears further study.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_fabric.1": "Spirit Fabric is a light yet sturdy material that acts as an insulator for spirit energies. While other materials have the same properties, it's not exactly practical to craft a pouch or clothing from stone. I'm not willing to go quite so far for my research as to try wearing something like $ithat/$.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_fabric.pouch.1": "But this fabric works wonderfully for storing spirit crystals. It keeps the arcana condensed within, and will even store spirits I pick up before they so much as clutter my pockets. It can store as many spirits as a single chest, making it quite convenient to carry around.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_focusing.1": "Using the opposing polarities of Twisted and Tainted Rock, I have created a device that draws in and focuses arcane energy. If given a compatible substrate, I can use this process to create things.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_focusing.2": "The basic substrate here is the Alchemical Impetus, an artifact similar to those I've seen in the past. By focusing arcana into it, I can cause bits of the calx to transmute into something new, though this damages the Impetus in the process.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion.1": "By using Runewood's natural magic as a base, I have designed the altar that will serve as the basis for my magecraft - the Spirit Altar. It is the other piece of the equation, the use for the arcana. By infusing them into items, and using the energies to effect other fusions, I can begin to explore this.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion.2": "To use the altar, I must lay the item I wish to infuse on top of it, along with an appropriate set of arcana. If I wish to fuse other items in the process, I must place them on some form of Runewood item holder. They must be within four blocks of the altar to work.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion.3": "Once all the arcana are present, the power within the crystals will begin to flow into the central item. If other items are fused in, they are pulled in during this process. When all of that is done, the product of the infusion will appear. It $iis/$ rather slow, though...",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion.alchemical_calx.1": "Lastly, I have created an experimental substrate I named Alchemical Calx. It's initially strong and tallow-like, but when met with a lesser amount of force it turns extremely malleable. It's bound to prove an useful ingredient.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion.hex_ash.1": "My first product with this process is a powder I call Hex Ash, after its color. It is a simple and useful grit, with the niter and sulfur mostly transmuted by the raw arcana, leaving a mixture of reagent and carbon.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion.living_flesh.1": "Next, for the sake of understanding how spirit arcana interacts with living substance, I have created... $isomething/$ which is now known as Living Flesh. It is a disgusting meaty chunk completely unfit for human consumption. Who knows if I'll end up finding a proper use for it.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.hallowed_gold.1": "Gold is often used as a thaumaturgical base, its natural conductivity of magic making it quite useful. Spirit arcana are no exception. In fact, using Sacred arcana, we can enhance those conductive properties.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.hallowed_gold.2": "Hallowed Gold, as a metal, acts much like its mundane counterpart. The inherent innocence of the arcana infused into the alloy makes other arcana glide through it smoothly, creating the perfect conductor for my purposes.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.hallowed_gold.spirit_jar.1": "A simple application of this metal is the Spirit Jar. As spirits in their raw form don't have mass, by trapping them under Hallowed Gold you can store far more than you could physically. The capacity of these jars is near-infinite, though each only stores one type of spirit.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.reexamination.1": "The inherent structures of the arcana simply don't exist in spirit metals, and yet they interact with the arcane all the same. There might be something analogous, but if so, I hardly have instruments precise enough to measure it. Why is this is different from the raw stones I have investigated, with even Soulstained Steel differing in structure vastly from Soulstone?",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.reexamination.2": "This might explain why Cthonic Gold has arcana fused into its structure, unlike the spirit metals - they might be different phenomena, one a metal 'tuned' to the arcana, another physically alloyed with it. I wonder if I can tune other metals similarly...",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.soulstained_steel.1": "Iron is mundane, in a word. By attuning the metal with Soulstone, I can create a steel that is $isimultaneously/$ in and out of phase with the world.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.soulstained_steel.2": "Anything made from Soulstained Steel is capable of striking the soul, without the need for specifics of engineering like with my crude scythe. Wearing the metal in its base form as armor is dangerous, as it will touch your own soul as well, so I must engineer a countermeasure.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_minerals.reexamination.1": "I now know the arcana have physical properties with meaning. I can use these properties to create a staff, and likely for many more things. But Soulstone and Brilliance... as far as I can tell, for every other base material relevant to the arcana save Runewood I work with, there are either spirit crystals fused within or patterned in the structure.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_minerals.reexamination.2": "The fact that Null Slate is physically identical to Soulstone implies a greater principle. I posit that Soulstone and Brilliance have similar fundamental resonances to the arcana, structures of inherent power at a precision far beyond what I can measure. This implies interaction with the arcane is simply... a quirk of an object's topology? I don't know how I would replicate it myself, but if I can...",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_stones.reexamination.1": "It appears that the crystal structures of at least Wicked and Sacred crystals can be tessellated infinitely, as that is exactly what my deconstruction and analysis of samples of Twisted and Tainted Rocks has found them to be. Is it possible that other spirit stones - or rather, tessellations - might exist? Very likely.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_stones.reexamination.2": "But what would their properties be? Sacred and Wicked create stone which accept or reject magic... so might Aerial and Earthen create stone that either moves or locks magic in place? Redundant for both, with Hallowed Gold... Infernal might be used to accelerate while Aqueous mutates, though, which might be useful.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_stones.reexamination.3": "I don't think I have the proper context to identify what Arcane, Eldritch, and Umbral might create. I lack the full understanding of what they represent, as destructive testing isn't an option for Umbral as of yet. But, with the proximity of bedrock to the Void... might bedrock's indestructibility be a sign of the Umbral stone?",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_stones.tainted_rock.1": "Stone is reluctant to change, but nothing can endure the power of an unchained soul forever. By using raw arcana to force that change, I have created stones with useful magical properties. With Sacred arcana as the catalyst, it forms Tainted Rock, a stone that dissipates magic nearby.",
