E.g. routers tick every 20 server ticks by default; a Sync Upgrade with a tuning upgrade of 15 ensures the router $(italic)always/$ runs 15 ticks after that, and that applies to $(italic)all/$ routers with a 15-tuned Sync Upgrade. And a 16-tuned Sync Upgrade always runs 1 tick after a 15-tuned Sync Upgrade, at least for routers with the same number of $(l:upgrades/speed)Speed Upgrades/$ installed..."

      "text": "Advanced notes #2: Because $(l:upgrades/speed)Speed Upgrades/$ make routers tick more frequently, they affect how Sync Upgrades work. A router with 9 Speed Upgrades ticks every 2 server ticks (instead of every 20). For Sync Upgrades in such a router, it only matters whether the tuning value is even or odd; 2 (or 4/6/8...) ticks later is effectively the same as 0 ticks later! General case: the tuning value is calculated modulo the router's actual tick rate after Speed Upgrades are accounted for."
