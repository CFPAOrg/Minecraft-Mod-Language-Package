If the block is broken, its primary drop(s) will be automatically inserted into the item router's buffer, if possible."

E.g. filtering on $(item)Stone/$ would not work to break Stone, unless the module has $(thing)Silk Touch/$ enabled. In this case, you should filter on $(item)Cobblestone/$.$(p)You can set the module to match by the $(thing)block/$ via the module GUI; this can be useful to distinguish between blocks that both drop nothing, e.g. $(item)Ice/$ and $(item)Packed Ice/$."
