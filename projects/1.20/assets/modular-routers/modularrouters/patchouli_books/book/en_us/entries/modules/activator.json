The module can also be configured to look $(thing)Above/$ or $(thing)Below/$ (default is $(thing)Level/$).$(p)$(thing)Above/$ is particularly handy for planting things on top of a solid block beside or above the router, while $(thing)Below/$ is useful when you want to target the ground directly adjacent to the router, rather than a more distant block."
