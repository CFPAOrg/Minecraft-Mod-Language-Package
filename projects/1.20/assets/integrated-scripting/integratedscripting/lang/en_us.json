  "info_book.integratedscripting.writing.variables.text2": "The most straightforward way to create a value in JavaScript and make it available in a static &lVariable Card&r value, is by defining a variable member in JavaScript using &olet&r or &oconst&r.",
  "info_book.integratedscripting.writing.variables.text3": "&olet&r defines variables that are re-assignable later in the script, such as counters. &oconst&r defines variables that can not be re-assigned.",

You can now use this &lVariable Card&r as you're used to, such as visualizing its value in a &lDisplay Panel&r.",
  "info_book.integratedscripting.writing.variables.text5": "Creating variables via JavaScript is mainly useful if you need to create complex values that are not easy to create using the &lLogic Programmer&r, such as long &4Strings&0 with a specific value. Below, you can find some examples of how to create such values.",

  "info_book.integratedscripting.writing.functions": "Functions",

  "info_book.integratedscripting.writing.functions.text4": "Binding JavaScript functions to a &lVariable Card&r as &2Operator&0, is done just like with constants and variables, by selecting the function member name in the Scripting Terminal text editor and binding it to a &lVariable Card&r. This value can now be used anywhere an &2Operator&0 is accepted.",
  "info_book.integratedscripting.writing.functions.text5": "For example, you can create a function with a single &8Item&0 argument that returns a &9Boolean&0 to use as filter &2Operator&0 for filtering a list of items that you read from a Chest.",

  "info_book.integratedscripting.writing.globals": "Global functions",
  "info_book.integratedscripting.writing.globals.text1": "When writing JavaScript code, you can make use of the global &oidContext&r variable to access all Integrated Dynamics operators as functions through the &oops&r field.

  "info_book.integratedscripting.writing.globals.text2": "For example, you can write an &8Item&0 filter that checks if an item is stackable and if it has a stack size of at least 16, as shown below.",
  "info_book.integratedscripting.writing.globals.text3": "To know what the name is of the operator you want to execute, you can look at their global name via the operator tooltips inside the &lLogic Programmer&r or in the list of operators in the Logic Programming section of this book.",
  "info_book.integratedscripting.writing.globals.text4": "Since invoking operators via &oidContext&r can become quite verbose, you can choose to store operators in a custom constant variable, as shown in the second example.

  "info_book.integratedscripting.writing.methods.text3": "Object methods are just plain functions, but their first argument is tied to the object value.",
  "info_book.integratedscripting.writing.methods.text4": "For example, the global function &oitemstackStackable&r takes a single &8Item&0 argument and outputs a &9Boolean&0. This function is available as a method on &8Item&0 values via the name &ostackable&r, which takes zero arguments.",
  "info_book.integratedscripting.writing.methods.text5": "Global functions that accept two or more arguments will be available as method on object values, with all arguments shifted by one.

  "info_book.integratedscripting.advanced.transient_storage.text4": "This way, you can keep track of states, such as counting the number of function calls, or calculating the running average of specific values.",
  "info_book.integratedscripting.advanced.transient_storage.text5": "An important catch to these variables is that their state is only transient. Concretely, this means that their values can be reset any time a variable card in the network is re-inserted, or when the server restarted.",
  "info_book.integratedscripting.advanced.transient_storage.text6": "As such, you can not assume these values to always remain present. If you need persistent data storage, it is better to make use of the &lDelayer&r.",
