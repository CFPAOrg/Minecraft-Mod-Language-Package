# Faulty Memory Card

<ItemImage id="mae2:faulty_card" scale="4" />

The Faulty Memory Card is an incorrectly assembled [memory
card](ae2:items-blocks-machines/memory_card.md) that glitches in a few
advantageous ways. It mainly helps out with repetative memory card tasks like
copying to many devices or setting up storage busses with increasing priority.

The Faulty Memory Card is used like a memory card, sneak use on a device to copy
its settings and use on a device to paste out the settings. Additionally you can
sneak use the card on the air to cycle through the modes or just use on the air
to do mode specific things (mainly cycle sub-modes).

# Modes
## AoE Paste
This mode will paste to any part in a square area around the part intially used
on. This only affect parts that are facing the same direction as the initial
one. Using on air will cycle the size of the AoE.

## Global Paste
This mode will paste to any part on the network that's of the same type
initially pasted too. **Be very careful**

## Incrementing/Decrementing
This mode will either increment or decrement the priority or level emitter
amount by one each time the settings are pasted. It can be cycled between
incrementing or decrementing by using on the air.
