# Semi-Vibrant Quartz Glass

<BlockImage id="mae2:cloud_chamber" scale="8" />

By doping <ItemLink id="ae2:quartz_vibrant_glass" /> with trace amounts of
<ItemLink id="minecraft:amethyst_shard" /> the particle production can be
inhibited. Particles instead will only be formed when stimulated by passing
radiation. This manifests as lines of particles being formed at random inside
the glass.

## Recipes

<RecipeFor id="mae2:cloud_chamber" />

Out of lore, this block is inspired by [cloud
chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_chamber) in real life. Cloud
chambers work by having box of supersaturated vapor (usually an alcohol). When
ionizing radiation passes through the vapor it causes it to condense, looking
like a trail of cloud.

The thick, short lines are supposed to be alpha particles. Alpha particles are
bigger, which means they make bigger trails, but also means they're stopped much
easier by the air.

The thin, long lines are supposed to be beta particles. Beta particles are
much smaller, which means they can travel through air a lot farther, but have
thinner trails. In reality, they should also be deflected sometimes, but
straight lines are nice and simple enough.
