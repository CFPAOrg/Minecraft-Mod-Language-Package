# Crazy AE2 Addons

Crazy AE2 Addons is a mod expanding the capabilities of Applied Energistics 2
by introducing advanced automation, data processing, and network control blocks.
Crazy AE2 Addons builds upon vanilla AE2 mechanics, requiring _almost_ all its
blocks to be part of an ME network to operate. It adds a suite of utilities.
