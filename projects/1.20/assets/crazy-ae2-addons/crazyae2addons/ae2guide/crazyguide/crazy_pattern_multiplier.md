# Crazy Pattern Multiplier

<ItemImage id="crazyae2addons:crazy_pattern_multiplier" scale="4"></ItemImage>

Crazy Pattern Multiplier is a handy item that lets you multiply the quantities in your AE2 processing patterns without rebuilding them by hand. You can scale inputs and outputs by any positive number.

Supports math expressions in the multiplier field (e.g., `2*(3+1)`).

## How to Use

1. **Open the GUI**: Hold the Crazy Pattern Multiplier in your hand and right click to open its interface. Youâ€™ll see a grid of 36 slots and a text field labeled "Multiplier".
2. **Set the multiplier**: Enter the number you want to scale by (for example, `2` to double, `0.5` to halve, or even `1k` for a thousandfold) in the text field.
3. **Apply to patterns**: Click the confirm button. The tool will replace each processing pattern in the slots with a new one whose inputs and outputs have been multiplied by your value.
4. **Sneak-Click support**: Sneak-right-click on any inventory (like a Pattern Provider block or a chest) to apply the last-used multiplier directly to all patterns in that inventory.
