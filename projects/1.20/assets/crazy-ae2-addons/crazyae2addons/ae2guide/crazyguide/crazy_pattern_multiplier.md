## [Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/__CiwpU4bbg&list=PLB8Rr5Xojkr5T1qoPr_4JdETiBkF4qF6r)

Crazy Pattern Multiplier is a handy item that lets you multiply the quantities
in your AE2 processing patterns without rebuilding them by hand.
You can scale inputs and outputs by any positive number.
Supports setting a limit above which it won't multiply your patterns.
Supports mass changing circuit numbers of all patterns inside it.

Supports math expressions in the multiplier field (e.g., `2*(3+1)`).

## How to Use

1. **Open the GUI**: Hold the Crazy Pattern Multiplier in your hand and right click to open its interface. You’ll see a grid of 36 slots and a text field labeled "Multiplier".
2. **Set the multiplier**: Enter the number you want to scale by (for example, `2` to double, `0.5` to halve, or even `1k` for a thousandfold) in the text field.
3. **Apply to patterns**: Click the confirm button. The tool will replace each processing pattern in the slots with a new one whose inputs and outputs have been multiplied by your value.
4. **Sneak-Click support**: Sneak-right-click on any inventory (like a Pattern Provider block or a chest) to apply the last-used multiplier directly to all patterns in that inventory.
