# Mob Export Bus

The Mob Export Bus is a special ME part that allows you to release stored mobs back into the world from your ME Storage. It works just like a regular Export Bus, but specifically for mobs.

## How to Use

1. **Place the Mob Export Bus**
2. **Configure What to Spawn**
   - Open the Mob Export Bus GUI.
   - Select which stored mob types you want the bus to export. You do so by using a proper spawn egg item, you can also drag it from JEI.

3. **Spawn Conditions**
   - The target block must be air.

## Important Notes

- **Mob Safety**: Ensure the spawn spot is not obstructed, or the bus will not spawn anything.
