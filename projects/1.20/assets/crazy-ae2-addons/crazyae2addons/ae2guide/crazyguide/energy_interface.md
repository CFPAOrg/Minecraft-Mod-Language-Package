# Energy Interface

The **Energy Interface** is a passive cable part that exposes your ME networkâ€™s stored AE energy as a Forge Energy.

---

## How It Works

- Acts like a battery from the perspective of FE.
- Energy available for extraction depends on the current AE network energy.
- Limits extraction to:
   - No more than **30%** of your total AE capacity.
   - No more than 500MFE, whichever is lower.
- Energy extracted is calculated at **2 FE = 1 AE**.
- Energy can also be **injected**, converting FE into AE at the same 2:1 ratio.
