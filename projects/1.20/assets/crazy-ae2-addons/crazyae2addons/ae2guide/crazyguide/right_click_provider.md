# Right Click Provider

Right Click Provider is a special part that automatically performs right-click actions for you. Instead of clicking by hand, you can attach this part to any ME cable face and let it handle tasks like using items on machines, planting seeds, or applying bone meal.

For now there is no way of automatically resupplying the part with items, so use unbreakable tools.

## How to Use

1. **Place the part**: Attach the Right Click Provider to any side of an ME cable.
2. **Open its GUI**: Right-click on the cable to open the part’s configuration screen.
3. **Insert an item**: You’ll see one slot. Put the item you want the part to use (for example, seeds, bone meal, or a wrench). If the slot is empty, the part will just right-click the block with an empty hand.
4. **Watch it work**: The part will simulate a right-click sometimes, if you add AE2 Speed Upgrades, it will perform actions faster.

## Upgrades

- **Speed Cards**: Install AE2 Speed Upgrades in the part to increase how many clicks it does.
