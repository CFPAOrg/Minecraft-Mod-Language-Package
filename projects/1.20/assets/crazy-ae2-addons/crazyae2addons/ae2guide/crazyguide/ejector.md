# Ejector

<BlockImage id="crazyae2addons:ejector" scale="4"></BlockImage>

The Ejector is an automation block that lets you push items, fluids, or other resources directly into the block in front of it - all triggered by a redstone pulse.

## How to Use

1. **Place the Ejector**
    - Put it facing the machine you want to send items into.

2. **Insert a Processing Pattern**
    - Open its GUI and insert a valid encoded processing pattern.
    - It has to be a processing pattern, and its output does not matter, ejector will only send the input.

3. **Trigger with Redstone**
    - Send a redstone pulse to the Ejector.
