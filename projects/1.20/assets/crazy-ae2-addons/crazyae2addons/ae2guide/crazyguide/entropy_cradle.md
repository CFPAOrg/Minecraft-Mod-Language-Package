# Entropy Cradle

The **Entropy Cradle** is a massive energy accumulator and transmutation multiblock.  
It stores up to **600 million FE**, and performs powerful **block transmutations** when fully charged.

## How It Works

1. **Charge**:
    - Charging stops at 600M FE.
    - Six capacitor layers light up progressively.
    - Capacitors emit comparator signal when the energy storage is full.

2. **Transmutation**:
    - On redstone pulse at full charge:
        - Cradle discharges.
        - If a known recipe structure is inside of it, it is replaced with a powerful block (e.g., Penrose Frame, Energy Storage Component).

## Notes

- Requires AE2 power and channels.
- Can be charged only via AE energy.
- You can find available recipes in JEI.
- You can fully automate crafting with it using the builder.
