# P2P Tunnel Conversion Recipes

To improve flexibility and reduce clutter, Crazy AE2 Addons introduces **Stonecutter recipes** that allow you to freely convert between various types of **P2P Tunnels** from AE2 and several addon mods.

## How It Works

- Simply place any existing P2P Tunnel in a **Stonecutter**.
- You’ll see all compatible P2P variants appear as conversion options.
- Select the one you need and take it out - no crafting table or materials required.
