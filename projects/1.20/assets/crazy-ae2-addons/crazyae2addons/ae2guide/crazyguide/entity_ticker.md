# Entity Ticker

The Entity Ticker is a unique ME part that dramatically speeds up the block entity you attach it to. It ticks the neighboring machine multiple times per game tick, making processes like smelting, machine operations, or other block entity updates much faster.

## How to Use

1. **Place the part**: Attach the Entity Ticker to an ME cable facing the machine or block entity you want to accelerate.
2. **Open its GUI**: Right-click the part to view energy usage and upgrade information.
3. **Install upgrades**:
    - **Speed Cards**: Each Speed Card installed doubles the ticking speed of the target block.
    - The maximum number of Speed Cards is 8.
4. **Power cost**:
    - The power consumption grows exponentially with each Speed Card.
    - Base energy usage is 256 FE/t without upgrades and quadruples per upgrade step.

The Entity Ticker is ideal for setups where you want to dramatically boost the performance of slow machines, but be prepared to provide a lot of power from your ME network!
