# Mob Annihilation Plane

The Mob Annihilation Plane is a special ME part that captures and stores mobs directly into your ME network. It instantly removes a mob standing in front of it and stores it inside your ME Storage system.

## How to Use

1. **Place the Mob Annihilation Plane**
2. **Storage Setup**
    - Make sure your network has space for "Mob Data" (Mob Storage Cells).
3. **That's all**

## Important Notes

- **Only works on true mobs**: Passive mobs, hostile mobs, but not players or non-mob entities.
