# Redstone Emitter

The Redstone Emitter is an ME part that acts like a digital redstone output. You can turn it ON or OFF via the Redstone Terminal.

---

## How to Use

1. **Place the Part**
    - Attach it to any side of an ME cable.

2. **Give It a Name**
    - Right-click it to open the GUI.
    - Type a custom name (up to 16 characters) to identify it uniquely in the network.
    - Names must be unique - duplicates are not allowed.

3. **Power Behavior**
    - Emits redstone signal when ON.
    - Signal strength is fixed at 15.
    - Can be toggled by the Redstone Terminal.

## Notes

- The Redstone Emitter does **not** respond to redstone input â€” it is output-only.
- Fully integrates with Redstone Terminal.
