Like seriously, is it worth keeping? Probably not. You should just throw it out now to save inventory space. There is other loot to pickup, far more valuable than this. What? You haven't thrown it out yet.. why? You really should, you know. Oh, and yes. Item names can be this long it turns out. Doesn't the tooltip look lovely?",
