I shall call it the appendix, For it is simply added on to the end of my large intestine... With these patterns, I appear to be able to read and write any arbitrary iota to it, Though I should be careful. If my biological iota storage becomes too dense, I fear it might cause severe inflammation of the appendix. Potentially even killing me.",

Because the iota storage is physically attached to my body, I am positive that if this body should ever be in some way destroyed beyond repair, The iota stored within would be destroyed as well.",
