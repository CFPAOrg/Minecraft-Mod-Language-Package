This means that despite being a fruit, they cannot be grown into a plant.$(br)To bring one home, one must harvest the fronds from the top, and then craft them with a Dirt Bucket to obtain a banana sucker.$(br)The sucker must be planted in gravel or sand, and will only grow while raining even if bone meal is used.$(br)Banana plants can be found in both jungles and beaches."
