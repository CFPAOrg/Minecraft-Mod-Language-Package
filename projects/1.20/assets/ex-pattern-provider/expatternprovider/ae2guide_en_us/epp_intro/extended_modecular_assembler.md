Extended Molecular Assembler is an advanced <ItemLink id="ae2:molecular_assembler" />.

It can run 8 crafting jobs at the same time (of course you need <ItemLink id="ae2:crafting_accelerator" /> in your ME network at first)
and 2x faster than the normal one.

However, it only supports the crafting job from <ItemLink id="ae2:pattern_provider" />. So you can't put a pattern in it directly.
