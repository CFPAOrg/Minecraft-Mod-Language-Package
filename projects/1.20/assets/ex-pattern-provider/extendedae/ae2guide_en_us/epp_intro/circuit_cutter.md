# Circuit Slicer

Can't tolerate the slow speed of inscriber? Now we have the Circuit Slicer! They can slice material block into processor 
[prints](ae2:items-blocks-machines/processors.md) directly, so they are 9x faster than inscriber at most time.

**Notice: The glass faces that don't have port can't connect to network.**
