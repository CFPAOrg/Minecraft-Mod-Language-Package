Luckily, items and $(blood)LP$() can be automatically piped in and out of the altar, albeit with a few caveats. $(br2)While a simple $(item)Hopper$() lets you pipe items in, the Altar won't stop it from inputting more than 1 at a time. It will happily craft 64 slates in one"

Perhaps a look at the $(l:bloodmagic:demon_will/item_routing/routing_nodes)Routing Nodes$() will be helpful..."

If you want to speed it up, you'd best look into $(l:bloodmagic:altar/blood_rune/acceleration_rune)Acceleration Runes$() and $(l:bloodmagic:altar/blood_rune/dislocation_rune)Displacement Runes$()."

This tank can hold $(thing)up to 10%$() of the $(blood)Life Essence$() that the altar itself can, so if the numbers don't appear to be adding up exactly right, or if $(blood)Life Essence$() appears to be vanishing from your altar, this is probably where it's going.
