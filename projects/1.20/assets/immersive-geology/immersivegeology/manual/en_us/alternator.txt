Alternator
Definitely Not a Dynamo
<&multiblock>The Alternator is a §lhigh-output power generator§r designed to convert §lRotational Energy§r into Electricity.

When paired with a <link;immersivegeology:steam_turbine;Steam Turbine> it's able to generate over §l12288 FE/t§r, more than three times the Diesel Generator.

§lOperation§r
- The number of power outputs limit the amount of power that can be extracted when using HV Connectors.
- You can gain more power output using Extra High Voltage Ground Cables potentially up to §l24576 FE/t§r.
