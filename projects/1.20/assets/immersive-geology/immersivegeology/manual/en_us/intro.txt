Immersive Geology
Mining with Style
This mod is currently IN DEVELOPMENT, thus you may encounter unformatted text things like 'immersivegeology.something.here'.
These are areas that our development team haven't had the time to polish, please do not report these as bugs.
In addition to this, the Processing Chains section of the Manual, that contains information on the recipe chains that
Immersive Geology adds are a WORK IN PROGRESS, do not report missing or incomplete chains as a bug.
