Chemical Reactor
Acidic Reconstruction
<&multiblock>The Chemical Reactor is a multiblock machine used to produce §lacidic mixtures§r vital for ore refinement.

§lInputs§r
- §lItems§r can be inserted via a hopper on the §ltop§r of the machine.
- §lFluids§r are added to the tanks located on the §lleft§r, §lback§r, and §lright§r sides.
  All input fluid tanks are §linterchangeable§r—any one can be used for any recipe.

If a tank contains §lleftover fluid§r, it can be extracted using a <link;fluid_transport;Pump;pump_recipe>. This allows you to save unused fluid instead of wasting it.

§lOutputs§r
Both outputs are located at the §lfront§r of the machine:
- The §lfluid output§r will automatically flow into connected tanks. Without a pump, it will only drain into tanks that are positioned §llower§r than the machine.
- The §litem output§r are not automatic. You must use an <link;conveyors;Extracting Conveyor Belt;conveyor_extract_recipe>.

§lRedstone Control§r
Powering the redstone input will §ldisable§r the machine, halting any recipe currently in progress.
Only the energy used so far is lost—§lno items or fluids are wasted§r.

While the machine is turned off, §linternal items§r can be extracted from the §lbottom§r of the multiblock.
It can be formed with the §lStainless Steel Work Hammer§r
