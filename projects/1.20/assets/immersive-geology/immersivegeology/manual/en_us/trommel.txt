Industrial Sluice
Go with the Flow
<&multiblock>The Industrial Sluice is a multiblock that is used to separate valuable minerals from ore. It operates by passing a slurry of crushed ore and water over a series of riffles or barriers that trap heavier materials, like gold or other metals, while lighter waste material washes away.
Although the Industrial Sluice requires power, unlike the Gravity Separator, it is more efficient at processing large quantities of material and excels in recovering fine particles, making it ideal for collecting rare earth metals.
