Core Drill
Drill of Intelligent Geological Goals
<&multiblock>This colossal drill is engineered to tap into the near-endless resources of the Lower Mantle.
To operate, it demands immense energy and a specialized mining fluid to penetrate the Mantle's depths. The harvested Mantle Fluid can be refined into a variety of metals, with the composition varying based on the drill's locationâ€”some areas yield fluid rich in rare or precious metals, offering vast wealth to those who master its use.
