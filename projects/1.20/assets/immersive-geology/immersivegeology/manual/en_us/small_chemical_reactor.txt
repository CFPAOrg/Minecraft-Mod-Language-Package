Basic Chemical Reactor
Chemical X not included.
<&multiblock>The Basic Chemical Reactor allows the combination of up to two fluids and one item.
Do not ingest the output. Do not inhale the input. If pressure exceeds 10 bars, run. (Joke)

It can be formed with the §lStainless Steel Work Hammer§r

§lInputs§r
- §lItems§r can be inserted via a hopper on the §lback§r of the machine.
- §lFluids§r are added to the tanks located on the §lleft§r, and §lright§r sides.
  The input fluid tanks are §linterchangeable§r, any one can be used for any recipe.

If a tank contains §lleftover fluid§r, it can be extracted using a <link;fluid_transport;Pump;pump_recipe>. This allows you to save unused fluid instead of wasting it.

§lOutputs§r
The Item output is located at the §lfront§r of the machine, while the Fluid Output is located to the §lright§r of the machine:
- The §lfluid output§r will automatically flow into connected tanks. Without a pump, it will only drain into tanks that are positioned §llower§r than the machine.
- The §litem output§r are not automatic. You must use an <link;conveyors;Extracting Conveyor Belt;conveyor_extract_recipe>.

§lRedstone Control§r
Powering the redstone input will §ldisable§r the machine, halting any recipe currently in progress.
Only the energy used so far is lost—§lno items or fluids are wasted§r.

§lDamage and Acid§r
Some acids (Hydrochloric Acid) will §ldamage§r the stainless steel in the machine, this can be repaired using §lStainless Steel Plate§r.
If you try to reform the machine to reset the damage counter, you'll find §lRuined Sheetmetal§r has replaced a proportional amount the §lStainless Steel Sheetmetal§r based on the damage amount.
