Reverberation Furnace
Filthy Brown Acid Rain
<&multiblock>The Reverberation Furnace is a specialized multiblock machine used to §lroast ores§r while collecting §lSulfur Dioxide gas§r as a byproduct.

This Multiblock can be formed using the <link;immersivegeology:getting_started;Bronze Work Hammer;bronzehammer> or Better.
Sulfur Dioxide is emitted from the §ltwo smokestacks§r on top of the structure. This gas is a key ingredient in the production of §lSulfuric Acid§r, which is essential for §2Hydrometallurgy§r processes.

The machine includes an internal buffer capable of storing up to §l24 Buckets§r of Sulfur Dioxide. If the buffer becomes full, any additional gas will be §lvoided§r, so be sure to extract it regularly.

To improve efficiency, you can install <link;improved_blast_furnace;Blast Furnace Preheaters;preheater> on either side of the machine. These increase the processing speed of the furnace significantly.

§lInput & Output Configuration§r

- §lItem and fuel inputs§r are inserted from the §ltop§r of the machine.
- §lOutputs§r are collected from the §lfront§r.
- The machine does §lnot§r automatically eject processed items—you'll need to use an <link;conveyors;Extracting Conveyor Belt;conveyor_extract_recipe> to pull items from the output.

§lDual-Recipe Support§r

A unique feature of the Reverberation Furnace is its ability to run §ltwo recipes simultaneously§r—one on each side of the machine. Each side operates independently and requires §lits own fuel input§r to function.
