<&multiblock>
The Crystallizer is a specialized form of electrolyzer designed to extract §lvaluable crystals§r from chemical solutions.
In some cases, it can also recover §lacid§r as a §lsecondary fluid output§r.

§lOutputs§r
- §lFluid outputs§r are automatically routed into any connected, valid fluid inventory. No pump is required—just connect a tank or pipe to the appropriate port.
- §lItem outputs§r are not automatic. You must use an <link;conveyors;Extracting Conveyor Belt;conveyor_extract_recipe> to remove solidified crystals from the machine.

Now you can close the loop in your §lHydrometallurgy§r Recipe Chains.
