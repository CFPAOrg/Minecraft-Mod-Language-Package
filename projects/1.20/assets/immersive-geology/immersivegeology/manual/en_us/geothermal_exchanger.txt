Geothermal Exchanger
Thermal Foundation
<&multiblock>The Geothermal Exchanger is a §lthermal transfer machine§r that uses real-world environmental heat to convert fluids into new states.
<np>
It leverages §lblock temperature§r beneath the structure to drive §lheating or cooling reactions§r between an input fluid and the output fluid.
§lCore Functionality§r
- Accepts an §linput fluid§r and attempts to convert it into an §loutput fluid§r.
- Also has a §lchance-based item output§r, produced as a byproduct during fluid transformation.
- Requires §lLV power§r to operate.
<np>
§lEnvironmental Interaction§r
- The exchanger draws heat energy from the §lnatural blocks directly below§r it to enable fluid processing.
- The §ltemperature difference§r between the input and desired output fluid determines whether a §lheating or cooling§r block is needed beneath the machine.
- As the machine runs, it can §lmodify§r these blocks, cooling or heating them gradually over time.
