The Rotary Kiln is a dynamic, multi-stage industrial machine capable of handling §lcomplex thermal recipes§r across a wide range of energy tiers.

§lHeat Tiers & Power Requirements§r
The Rotary Kiln changes its processing capabilities based on §lhow much power§r it receives:

Each recipe is tied to a §lspecific heat level§r. If the machine is outside the required range, the recipe will §lpause§r until the proper heat tier is restored.

The Rotary Kiln is designed for §lprogressive heat-based processing§r and supports up to §l7 concurrent recipes§r, all operating at the same heat level.

§lThermal Behavior§r
- Reaching a new heat level requires the §lfull input power§r defined for that tier.

- Once the machine is heated, the §lidle upkeep cost§r drops to about ~§l33%§r. It is more efficient at lower power tiers.

- While running a recipe, the §lactive upkeep§r is reduced to between ~§l25-75%§r of the required input based on the number of recipes.

§lTips for Use§r
- Use §lpower-regulating systems§r such as capacitors, transformers or breaker switches to control the heat tier precisely.
- You can 'overclock' to a higher heat level using three of the lower tier energy connector, for example §lMedium Heat§r can be achieved using §lthree§r LV connectors at max input.
