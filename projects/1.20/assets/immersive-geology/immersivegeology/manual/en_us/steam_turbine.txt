Steam Turbine
Spin me around
<&multiblock>The Steam Turbine is a §lhigh-output power generator§r designed to convert §lpressurized steam§r into energy.

Capable of generating up to §l12288 FE/t§r—three times more than a Diesel Generator.


§lOperation§r
- The turbine runs exclusively on §lSteam§r as its fuel source.
- Currently, steam can only be produced via a §lGeothermal Exchanger§r
<np>
§lSteam Handling§r
- The internal §lsteam buffer§r is intentionally small (500 mB) to encourage steady, pressurized input.
- As the turbine consumes steam, it returns §lhalf§r of the input volume as §lWater§r.
<np>
§lWater Recovery§r
- Reclaimed water is stored in a §l250 mB§r internal buffer.
- If this buffer fills and no valid output is available, the turbine will §lhalt automatically§r, You must extract water to resume operation.
