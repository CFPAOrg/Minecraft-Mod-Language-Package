Getting Started
Sticks and Stones
<&stonehammer>
Starting out, you will need to create a §lStone Work Hammer§r, this tool will allow you to §2form§r the <link;immersivegeology:bloomery;crude bloomery> and <link;alloykiln;alloy kiln>.
It also gives you access to the crude <crushing process> for raw ore.
<np>
<&crude_crushing>
In order to gain access to the valuable metals from the raw ore, we must first crush it, using a hammer is crude losing an amount in the process.
<&geopick>
The §lGeologist's Pick§r, can find any three minerals within a 1 chunk radius of you, ordered by most abundant.
The most useful starting minerals are §lCuprite§r and §lCassiterite§r, which can be processed into Copper and Tin respectively.
<&bronzehammer>
Finally, after collecting enough §2Copper§r and §2Tin§r for Bronze, you can now craft the §lBronze Work Hammer§r, this is an upgrade to the Stone Work Hammer.
<np>
Using this, you can now §2form§r the <link;immersivegeology:reverberation_furnace;Reverberation Furnace>, <link;crude_blast_furnace;Blast Furnace> and the <link;cokeoven;Coke Oven>.
This is a massive leap forward and unlocks LV and MV technology.
