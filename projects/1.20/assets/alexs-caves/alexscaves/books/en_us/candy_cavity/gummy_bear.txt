    Gummy Bears are animals made entirely of gelatin. These squishy bears are often found near Purple Soda rivers and bottles, hoping to scoop up a Sweetish Fish in the matching gelatin color. Although neutral towards other creatures, Gummy Bears will fiercely defend any babies near them.
    If a Gummy Bear is fed any kind of potion, it will begin to enter Hibernation mode. This means that the bear will fall asleep for a period of time up to several days. Once the bear awakens, it will seek out the nearest Licoroot to scratch its back against. This will dislodge several Jelly Beans from the hide of the beast.
    These Jelly Beans will all have the same effects and duration of the potion fed to the Gummy Bear days prior when eaten. Gummy Bears can be bred with the Sweetish Fish that corresponds to their color. They drop Gelatin on death.
