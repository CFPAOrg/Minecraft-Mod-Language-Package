    The Candy Cavity is believed to be a relatively recent addition to the overworld, likely being created as a byproduct of nefarious magical experiments carried out by its native powerful sorcerers, the Licowitches.





    Inside the biome, the terrain consists primarily of Blocks of Chocolate, Frosted Blocks of Chocolate, and Cake Layers, which make the biome feel uncannily like a large slice of layer cake. Intersecting these are plenty of roads made of Rock Candy and rivers of Purple Soda.
    The biome is kept surprisingly well lit for a cave biome by the presence of Sundrops, magical gummy candies infused with the very power of the sun. Rainbows can often be seen arcing between Sundrops. Large scoops of ice cream can be seen in piles emerging from the floor, which are complimented by giant cones hanging from the ceiling.
    Also complimenting this sweet atmosphere are giant candy canes, lollipops, chocolate bars, gobstoppers, cookies, donuts, and the Licoroot, a native tree to the Candy Cavity. Although this place may seem to be a walk in the park, there is more to its sweetened appearance...
