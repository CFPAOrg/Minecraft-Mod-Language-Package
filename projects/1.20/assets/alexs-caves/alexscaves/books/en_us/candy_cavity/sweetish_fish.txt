    The Sweetish Fish is one of many curious creatures found dwelling in the Candy Cavity, although this unique fish is the only one seen to swim through the underground rivers and bottles of Purple Soda.
    Like other animals in this biome, it seems to be a construct made of living candy. And, just like other gelatinous creatures, it comes in multiple color variations.
    Sweetish Fish can be captured in a Bucket of Soda.
    If slain and cooked, a Sweetish Fish will turn into §lGelatin§r, a common crafting ingredient.
