    Candicorns are creatures that appear to be similar to the horse, albeit composed out of various different kinds of candy. Candicorns have a horn atop their heads, which they use to defend themselves from any attackers.
    They appear in small herd within the Candy Cavity, and are neutral to all other creatures.
    Candicorns can be tamed by feeding them several Caramel Apples. Once tamed, a saddle can be placed on a Candicorn in order to ride it. When ridden at high speeds, Candicorn will slowly build up the ability to charge. Once this charge is released, their speed will massively increase, and they will damage all other creatures that stand in their way.
    Candicorn drop sugar if slain and can be bred with Candy Canes. A baby Candicorn will take on the color variant of one of its parents.
