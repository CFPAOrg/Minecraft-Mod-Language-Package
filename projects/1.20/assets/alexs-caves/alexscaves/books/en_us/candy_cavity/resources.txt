    The ice cream found in the Candy Cavity comes in three flavors: Vanilla, Chocolate and Sweetberry. When these blocks are broken, the resulting scoop items can be thrown like snowballs. Due to them being made out of milk, a target hit by one of these scoops will have any potion effects removed.
    All sugary foods found inside the Candy Cavity have a very small chance of inflicting the Sugar Rush effect when consumed. This effectively slows down time for the consumer of these foods, and allows them to move an attack faster, for a very short period. The most effective food to eat to gain Sugar Rush is the Sundae.






    Candy Canes are a common resource found in the Candy Cavity, and are used for a variety of different crafting recipes. They can be combined with Frostmint, a very reactive mint block, to create Frostmint Spears.






    When these spears hit a target, they inflict it with a freezing condition similar to powdered snow. They also deal damage in an area when on impact.
    Frostmint reacts explosively with Purple Soda, and if a falling Frostmint block touches the liquid it will explode violently. This reaction can be utilized to create Purple Soda Rockets, which can replace the functionality of firework rockets for elytra flight.
