    The Brainiac is a monstrous mutant made of several zombies and other unknown monsters. Brainiacs are fast, aggressive, strong, and in possession of a large tongue that can whip targets from a distance.
    Usually, Brainiacs can be found carrying around a Waste Drum on their backs. When in combat, they can either drink this to heal quickly, or use it as a range attack to spread acid near their targets.
