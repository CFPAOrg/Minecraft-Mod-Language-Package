    Most of the terrain of the Toxic Caves consists of Radrock, an irradiated variant of stone. This Radrock occasionally bears Uranium Ore inside it as well, which is also exclusive to this biome in such quantities.
    Dividing the open spaces of the Toxic Caves are large pits full of Acid, a dangerous liquid that can corrode the armor of anything that enters it - before corroding the creature itself. Acid can also create Rusty versions of Scrap Metal blocks when it flows over it.
    Geothermal Vents can be seen rising from these acidic pits, constantly bubbling and spewing out gas. The Toxic Caves also feature the occasional Sulfur Stack, which can grow in size provided there is a block of Acidic Radrock dripping onto it.






    Within the Toxic Caves, numerous ruins of past industrial and atomic progress can be spotted. These often contain loot of some kind, but venturing near them could also expose any adventurer to radiation by picking up any radioactive items - such as a Waste Drum or Uranium Rod.
    Irradiated is a nasty effect that stops all natural healing from occurring while active. Higher levels of this effect also inflict damage at a constant rate - making it a death sentence if not dealt with quickly.
