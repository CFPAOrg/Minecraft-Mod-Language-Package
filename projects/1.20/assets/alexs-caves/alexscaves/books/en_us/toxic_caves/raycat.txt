    The Raycat is a skeletal, undead feline kept alive by its radioactive powers. Although somewhat intimidating with its green glow, this cat is passive. Raycats do not need to feed since they heal by absorbing radiation from other nearby creatures, but they still will gladly accept Radgills.
    If fed a few of these Radgills, the Raycat can become tamed. Tamed Raycats can be made to follow, stay or wander. Although they will not defend their owner in combat, they will keep Nucleepers at a distance and occasionally absorb any Irradiated Effect of their owner. They can be bred with Radgills.
