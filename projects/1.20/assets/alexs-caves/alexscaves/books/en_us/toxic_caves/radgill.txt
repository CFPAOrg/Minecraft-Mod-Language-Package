    Radgill are hideously mutated fish found swimming through pits of Acid in the Toxic Caves. These three-eyed fish can occasionally be seen leaping from the Acid into the air.
    Radgill can be captured in a Bucket of Acid, and can also survive in water. If a Radgill is slain, it can drop itself as an item, which can be cooked.
