    The Watcher is a monster that can be found in the Forlorn Hollows, but only appears as the result of an Underzealot sacrifice of a Gloomoth.
    Watchers will seek out any adventurer over a great distance, and begin to stalk them. Occasionally, they make their presense known by possessing their target, and forcing their target to see the world from the Watcher's perspective. During this possession the target cannot move, and afterwards the Watcher's moth face appears shortly in their vision.
    When a Watcher is close enough, it will quickly lash out with its sharp claws, before transforming into an ethereal flying form. It will then continouslly posess its target whilst lashing at it, making it a difficult fight.
    If a Watcher is slain, it will drop some Dark Tatters along with an occasional Â§lOccult Â§lGemÂ§r.
