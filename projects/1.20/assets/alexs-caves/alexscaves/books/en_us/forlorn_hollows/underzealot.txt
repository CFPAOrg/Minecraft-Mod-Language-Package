    Underzealots are intelligent, mole-like cultists found wandering the Forlorn Hollows. These hostile creatures have poor vision, so they have a naturally low detection range. However, fighting them is not easy as after every slash from their claws, they will burrow underground and appear somewhere else nearby.
    Underzealots almost always appear in groups, making combat with them even more difficult. Fearing light, Underzealots will regularly break any many light sources they can - including torches. But there are worse reasons to fear these stout cultists - their rituals.
    When they find a Gloomoth, presumably one fluttering around a low-laying torch, they will attempt to run after it and catch it. If they do, then a ritual will start if three or more other Underzealots take notice.
    During this ritual, an eminence of a dark, otherworldly power will breifly appear in this realm. It will focus all of its dark energy on the hapless sacrifice, warping it into a new kind of monster. For Gloomoths, this new monster is the Watcher.
    But as mentioned prior, the Underzealots do have poor vision, and often they will attempt to pick up another flying creature that makes its home in the Forlorn Hollows. When the sacrifice is complete for this creature, an extremely powerful monster is created - one that even the Underzealots have no control of.
    If an Underzealot is slain, it will drop some of its Â§lDark Â§lTattersÂ§r that make up its robes. They can also very rarely drop a Â§lDesolate Â§lDaggerÂ§r...
