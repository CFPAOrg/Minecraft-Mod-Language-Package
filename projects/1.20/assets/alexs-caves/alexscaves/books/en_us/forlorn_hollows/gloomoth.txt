    Gloomoths are large, passive insects found fluttering through the darkness of the Forlorn Hollows. These bugs are prey to many of the large mammals here, and like their predators they have also been twisted by the darkness - though nowhere near as much.
    Gloomoths naturally seek out light sources, as it is part of how they navigate. This leads them to cluster around light-emitting blocks such as torches. Naturally, this brings them both close to the ground and brings in plenty of nearby predators that would usually stay lurking in the dark.
    Although they are no threat in themselves, Gloomoths represent far greater danger because of the predators they can bring. If slain, they can drop §lMoth §lDust§r.
