    Vespers are gigantic bats twisted by the darkness of the Forlorn Hollows. They can either be found in pursuit of Gloomoths, their favorite prey, or roosting, hanging the ceiling.
    These hostile bats will attack any adventurer that wanders beneath them while roosting, and will continuously swoop in and out of the darkness to deal a nasty bite. If blocked with a shield, they will be temporarily grounded, making them easier to defeat.
    If slain, they can drop a Â§lVesper Â§lWingÂ§r and some Guano.
    Vespers can also be grabbed by the resident Underzealots to be used in their rituals, to create a very powerful monster...
