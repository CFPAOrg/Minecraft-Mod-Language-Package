    Corrodents are fossorial rodents found tunneling through the walls and floors of the Forlorn Hollows. These hostile beasts will emerge when they detect prey near them, and attempt to bite with their sharp front teeth.
    They can be difficult to fight, due to their ability to easily move through almost any block. But Corrodents are deathly afraid of all light, and simply placing a bright light like a torch near them will shock and scare them. During this attempt to flee, they can easily be slain.
    If slain, Corrodents can drop some of the coarse dirt they have dug up, and possibly some Â§lCorrodent Â§lTeethÂ§r.
