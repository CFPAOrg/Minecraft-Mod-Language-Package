    Mine Guardians are often difficult to see in the Abyssal Chasm, as they are always chained to an anchor on the seafloor around Abyssal Ruins. These mechanical beings were left there long ago, likely to keep deep ones away.
    Every so often, Mine Guardians will open their single eye to scan for targets - including any nearby adventurers. If a target is detected in close range, the Mine Guardian will begin to float towards the detected target, then suddenly explode once in range.
    If slain before this happens, Mine Guardians can drop a Â§lDepth Â§lChargeÂ§r, which can be thrown to create a small explosion that can destroy blocks, even underwater.
