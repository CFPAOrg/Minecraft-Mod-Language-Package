    The Lanternfish is the smallest fish found in the Abyssal Chasm, yet it makes up for its diminutive size for the large shoals of them that spawn throughout the waters of this biome.
    Like a few other deep sea species, this animal has light emitting spots on its body, which help distinguish it from the dark depths.
    Lanternfish shoals move closer to the surface at night, making them a convenient way to find Abyssal Chasms.
    If slain, a Lanternfish will drop itself, and can be cooked for a meager snack. They can also be captured in a Bucket of Water.
