    The Deep One Mage is the third species of Deep One, and distantly related to the others. Yet they still fulfill an invaluable role in the Deep One society - Mages have control over powerful water magic. Like all Deep Ones, they share the same opinion of outsiders.
    Channeling the Heart of the Sea buried in their heads, these Deep Ones can summon bolts of water to pummel enemies from afar with. To voyage out of water they can summon a bubble full of water to allow them to levitate. They can also bring forth a barrage of waves to damage multiple attackers at once. Some of the Deep One Mage's attacks will trap foes in a giant bubble of water, which can drown land dwellers.
    Like all Deep Ones, Mages have their own unique set of items they can exchange at an Abyssal Altar. These range from common ocean items to rarer and magical ones, such as nautilus shells, bottles of enchanting and even the Â§lSea Â§lStaffÂ§r itself.
