    The Tripodfish is a bizzare fish found near the seafloor of the Abyssal Caves. Although they are decent swimmers, they can often be spotted resting above the seafloor on 3 large spines emerging from their fins.
    Tripodfish can be captured with a bucket of water, and if slain they can drop themselves. They can be cooked for a heartier meal.
