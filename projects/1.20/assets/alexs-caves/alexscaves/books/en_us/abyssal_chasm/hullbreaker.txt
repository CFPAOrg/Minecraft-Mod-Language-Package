    The Hullbreaker is a colossal fish over fifteen blocks long. Being a predator adapted to hunt exclusively in dark waters, it hunts by seeking out any glowing entity.
    It quickly makes a kill by using its massive teeth to bite prey or its head as a battering ram to smash them. The easiest way to avoid the wandering eyes of a Hullbreaker is to stop emitting light, and to remove any glowing effect or entity.
    Hullbreakers always investigate possible prey items before attacking, circling them multiple times whilst its many body lights begin to flash rapidly.
    In the almost unheard of chance that one is defeated in combat, it will spew out what it has eaten before dying. This includes common items like ink sacs, but can also be remains of Â§lSubmarinesÂ§r such as the Â§lEnigmatic Â§lEngineÂ§r, along with strange things such as Â§lImmortal Â§lEmbryosÂ§r.
    If a hullbreaker is detected whilst one is in a submarine, caution must be taken to immediately turn off any and all floodlights until the beast passes...
