    It is found exclusively under ocean biomes, and appears as a massive trench where light barely penetrates. The trench walls are lined with Abyssmarine, a stone-like block, and the abyssal floor is covered in a thick layer of Muck.





    This Muck is quite thick and slows many creatures that walk on it down. It is also where much of the benthic sea life that calls this biome home can be found, including mussels, Sea Anemones, and Ping-Pong Sponges.





    Rising from these abyssal depths are great undersea mounts made of tuff. These can contain numerous ores, but are also covered by Hydrothermal Vents emanating black smoke and Tube Worm colonies nearby to feed off of them.
    On the ocean floor the skeletons of long dead beasts, whalefalls, can be found, colonized by Bone Worms and other scavengers.
    Long-abandoned research posts created by an enigmatic, ancient faction can also be discovered, along with far more mysterious ruins...
