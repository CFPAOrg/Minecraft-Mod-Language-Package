    Mussels can be cooked into a decent food option, too.





    When broken, there is a chance for a mussel to drop one of its precious Pearls, which can be made into an Abyssal Altar, presumably to offer something to the strange beings that call the Abyssal Chasm home.







    Occasionally, Sea Glass Shards can be obtained when breaking muck. These shards can be reassembled into normal glass, or used to create Depth Glass, which allows better visibility when placed next to water.
