

    §lHIDDEN §lBENEATH §lTHE §lSURFACE §lOF §lTHE §lOVERWORLD §rlies many unique cave biomes, all rare in nature.

    These cave biomes are sought out not only for their novelty, but also due to the various powerful and legendary contents of each.
    Of these biomes, five are known to exist:

    • {Magnetic Caves|magnetic_caves/chapter.json}
    • {Primordial Caves|primordial_caves/chapter.json}
    • {Toxic Caves|toxic_caves/chapter.json}
    • {Abyssal Chasm|abyssal_chasm/chapter.json}
    • {Forlorn Hollows|forlorn_hollows/chapter.json}



    To uncover more about each of these caves, seek out an §lUnderground §lCabin§r...
    Underground Cabins can be occasionally found in caves throughout the Overworld.

    Cartographers can occasionally sell maps to them, which can also be found in Mineshaft Chests.

    Asides from ordinary loot, Underground Cabins contain §lCave §lTablets§r.







    Cave Tablets can be placed along with a paper in a §lSpelunkery §lTable§r, another unique find in a cabin.

    Then, one can begin translating the Cave Tablet...
    When both the tablet and paper are on the table, various runes on the tablet will be visible.

    Interacting with any rune will reveal it. A revealed word's translation can be seen by moving the lens over the word. Only five attempts can be made before the tablet is destroyed.




    Using the knowledge of which runes represent which letters can help find the targeted word. If this process is completed three times, the tablet and paper will become a §lCave §lCodex§r.

    These codices have multiple uses. They can be used to gain more knowledge about the specific cave biome which they relate to.






    Additionally, extra codices can be crafted with paper to craft a  §lCave §lMap§r.








    Cave Maps can point to the nearest cave biome detailed by the codex. The process of creating a Cave Codex seems to imdue this map with an uncanny range and responsiveness.
