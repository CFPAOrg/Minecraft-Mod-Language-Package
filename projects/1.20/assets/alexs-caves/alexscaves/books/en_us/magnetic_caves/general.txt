    Scarlet Neodymium attracts all metallic objects, such as iron and netherite equipment, whereas Azure repels them.
    It is still unknown how or why this biome has Neodymium in vast quantities, although it has not been without effect on the local area - numerous beings have adapted to this place and call it home, and the caves are littered with odd mining bases created with the purpose of extracting as many minerals from this place as possible.
    Due to the effects of magnetism on iron and netherite equipment, it is best to explore the Magnetic Caves using non-magnetic armor and tools - although, there are some positives to using metal boots.
    If worn, they can allow the wearer to walk on any surface of a Scarlet Neodymium block, including the sides and underneath.

    The Neodymium is not the only resource worth journeying here for - these caves are rich in iron, and the Galena they are made from also has its uses...

    Amongst the crystals of the Magnetic Caves, Tesla Bulbs can also be found. These volatile blocks may look pretty, but their lightning can zap anything that walks near. They can also explode if broken or hit with a projectile.

    The Magnetic Caves can take a strange shape of floating galena clusters within a cave itself, held up entirely by the latent magnetic powers of the biome. This can make them difficult, albeit interesting to traverse.
