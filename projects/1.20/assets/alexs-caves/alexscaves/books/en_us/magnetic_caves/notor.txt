    The Notor is a strange, hovering passive creature found in the Magnetic Caves. Although it cannot attack, they are definitely nuisances in their own right, as Notors will attempt to scan any foreign beings nearby.
    Notors will use these scans to build a hologram, in order to report back to monsters in this biome about possible invaders. Any monster witnessing these holograms will instantly know where to focus its aggressive energy on.
    When killed, Notors can drop a §lNotor §lGizmo§r, the source of their holographic abilities...
