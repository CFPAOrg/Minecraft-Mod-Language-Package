

    Galena is a type of stone with a significant iron composition. It can be crafted into numerous kinds of bricks, pillars, and other blocks, and Packed Galena.






    Packed Galena can then be smelted to produce a single nugget of iron.





    Although this requires a great deal of Galena to create a single ingot of iron, it exists in such vast quantities in this cave biome that make it a good alternative to seeking out iron ore.
    Far more valuable of a resource than Galena is Neodymium though. The raw form of both Scarlet and Azure Neodymium can be obtained by breaking both pillars and nodes that make up the giant crystals of this biome.
    These can be crafted back into the nodes or used to make Neodymium Ingots.






    Neodymium Ingots have many uses. The Azure Neodymium Ingot can be used to create Magnetic Levitation Rails, which lift any minecart that rolls over them into the air - and moves it faster than any normal rail.






    The Scarlet Neodymium Ingot crafted into create Seeking Arrows, which will curve towards any nearby entity they fly past.







    Neodymium has other powerful uses, but most of these require the remains of powerful beings...
