    Meditating over the floor of the Magnetic Caves is the Teletor, Galena-covered beings of dubious origin.
    Although they may seem calm and collected while doing this, Teletor are extremely hostile. Above their large, magnetic heads usually rests an iron tool of some kind. This tool is their main weapon, and they can move it back and forth to deal continous ranged damage. These tools can be anything from a weak iron hoe to an enchanted iron sword.

    Using their magnetic meditation powers, Teletor also have the latent ability to fly, although only at slow speeds. They can strafe in the air while attacking, making them a danger to any explorers of the Magnetic Caves.

    If slain, a Teletor can drop a Â§lTelecoreÂ§r with some Scarlet or Azure Neodymium. This makes them a renewable source of these precious minerals - although this comes at a cost.
