    The Atlatitan is the living, non-possessed version of the undead Luxtructosaurus, and only begins to appear in the world after this boss has been slain.
    Unlike its twisted undead version, this creature is a neutral herbivore, seemingly content preening the leaves and pewen needles that are plentiful in the Primordial Caves.
    Atlatitan is not entirely defenseless however, and can attack using its powerful tail and a quick kick with its spiked front legs.
    Although it cannot be tamed, the Altatitan can be fed some Serene Salad to make it into a temporary mount. When ridden, they have a special ability that enables them to flatten out an entire area by unleashing a powerful stomp. This makes them perfect for terraforming areas to prepare them for building.
    Like other herbivorous dinosaurs, it can be bred with Tree Stars to produce a single, giant egg. Atlatitans drop plenty of Heavy Bones and Dinosaur Chops if defeated, although this is rare since they have no natural predators.
