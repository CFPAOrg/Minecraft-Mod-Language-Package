    The Subterranodon is a large, neutral flying reptile found in roosts on the sides of the Primordial Caves, or flying through its vast underground hollows. Although its large mouth is lined with spiky teeth, its diet consists mostly of aquatic life.
    Subterranodon nests are an occasional sight, emerging on rocky outcrops on pillars. Subterranodons can be lured and bred with a cod, and will produce one of their eggs, which can also be found in their nests.
    A Subterranodon can be tamed by feeding it a few Trilocaris Tails. Tamed Subterranodons can be made to follow, stay or wander when interacted with while sneaking.
    To ride a tamed Subterranodon, simply interact with it. They can only fly upwards for a short period while carrying a rider in their feet, thus making frequent landings required. Still, they provide an excellent way to travel within the Primordial Caves.
