    The Relicheirus is a massive, neutral omnivorous dinosaur uncommonly found browsing the pewen trees of the Primordial Caves. This feathery dinosaur is immensely strong, and can deal a lot of damage with its dagger-like claws.
    They will nibble at any tree leaves within the range of their long necks, and will reach down into pools to gobble up any Trilocaris they can find.
    One can utilize the natural strength of this dinosaur by feeding it a Primordial Soup, which will energize it to the point of knocking down almost any nearby tree it can find, all at once.
    Relicheirus can be bred with a Tree Star, and will produce a single large egg afterwards.
    When slain, a Relicheirus will drop many feathers, a few Â§lDinosaur Â§lChopsÂ§r and some Â§lHeavy Â§lBonesÂ§r.
