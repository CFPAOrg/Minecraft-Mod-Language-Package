    Vallumraptors are pack-hunting dinosaurs found commonly within the Primordial Caves. Ever on the prowl, these beasts will attempt to take down prey big and small - from local golden frogs to even a Grottoceratops, and even the occasional explorer.
    Attacking in tandem, these fearsome reptiles will leap great distances at their prey, all while others from their pack slash and bite, quickly dealing a large amount of damage in total.
    All Vallumraptor packs are usually led by an Elder, denoted by their orange markings and larger stature. Elders are stronger and have decent armor protection as well. If a Vallumraptor pack loses its Elder in combat, they usually will disperse from battle. Vallumraptors communicate with their pack through their calls.
    Vallumraptors can also open doors and chests using their crafty hands. They will steal any meat items from chests they can find. If a Dinosaur Nugget is taken from a chest by a Vallumraptor, it may enter a relaxed state after consuming it.
    During this relaxed state, the Vallumraptor can be approached and fed a Serene Salad in order to tame it. Tamed Vallumraptors can be made to follow, stay or wander, and are indispensable in combat due to their sneaky abilities.
    If a tamed Vallumraptor loses a lot of its health in battle, it will enter a stealth mode and rapidly begin to heal, only to re-enter combat once safely recovered.
    Tamed Vallumraptors can be bred with a Dinosaur Nugget, and will lay a clutch of eggs afterwards. Baby Vallumraptors that hatch nearby will imprint on their parent's owners.
