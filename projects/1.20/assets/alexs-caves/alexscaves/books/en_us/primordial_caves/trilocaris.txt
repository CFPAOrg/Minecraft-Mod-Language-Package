    Trilocaris are small prehistoric arthropods that can be found swimming in the many lakes and pools of the Primordial Caves. They can survive both in and out of water, and will bite if attacked first.
    They can be captured in a bucket, and if killed will drop a Trilocaris Tail. Trilocaris are frequent prey for many other denizens of this biome.
