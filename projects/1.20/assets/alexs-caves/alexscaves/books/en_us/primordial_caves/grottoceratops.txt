    Grottoceratops are large, herbivorous dinosaurs that seem to think only ever of eating more plants. These voracious reptiles will gladly ignore almost anything else in their way, as long as it does noy attack them first.
    Grottoceratops is the only source of Â§lFiddleheadsÂ§r, which appear after they pick up and eat a Curly Fern.
    If attacked, they will defend themselves by using their large horn to fling attackers in the air, or by swinging their spiked tail into their target.
    Grottoceratops can be bred with a Tree Star, and will lay a single egg afterwards. When slain, Grottoceratops can drop a Â§lDinosaur Â§lChopÂ§r and some of its Â§lTough Â§lHideÂ§r.
