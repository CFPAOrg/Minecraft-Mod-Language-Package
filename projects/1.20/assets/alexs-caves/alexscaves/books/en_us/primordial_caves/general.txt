    The subterranean biome is kept well-lit by Ambersol, a novel form of amber that illuminates all blocks beneath it. It appears within amber clusters on the ceiling of these massive caves.





    This illuminating power gives the entire biome a brightness equivalent to daytime on the surface, explaining the lack of monsters and the large, prehistoric plants growing in this biome.
    Cheifly among these are the Pewen trees that cover the landscape, along with Ancient Jungle Trees, Curly Ferns, Cycads and Flytraps. The ground is covered with moss and grass, and muddy lakes appear across the cave floor.






    Just because this prehistoric paradise lacks monsters does not make it fully safe to explore, however...
