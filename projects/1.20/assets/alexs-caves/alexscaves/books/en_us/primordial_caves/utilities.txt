

    Occasionally when breaking amber, an Amber Curiosity can be discovered. These can be used to craft §lAmber §lMonoliths§r, which can also be seen dotting the Primordial Caves. Amber Monoliths can repopulate the nearby area of animals over the course of a few days. The type of animal spawned depends on any nearby animals and the natural rate of occurance of that animal. It is possible that the Amber Monoliths are the reason the Primordial Caves have stayed the same for eons.





    The numerous food items of the Primordial Caves can be cooked or made straight into different dishes.










    The §lSerene §lSalad§r can remove the Stunned effect when consumed. It can also be used to tame some dinosaurs.






    The §lSeething §lStew§r inflicts the Rage effect, which boosts damage dependent on how little health is left. If given to other creatures, it can cause them to attack other nearby entities.






    The §lPrimordial §lSoup§r is an invigorating stew that inflicts haste. If given to a Relicheirus, it can start to knock over nearby trees for a short period.






    The Cooked Dinosaur Chop can also be directly crafted into twelve §lDinosaur §lNuggets§r.
    With the Heavy Bone dropped by many larger dinosaurs, the §lPrimitive §lClub§r can be crafted.






    This weapon is slow and cumbersome to use, but when slammed against a creature, there is a chance to inflict the Stunned effect for up to 15 seconds. When Stunned, creatures cannot move or melee attack.

    The Heavy Bone can also be used with Tough Hide to craft the §lPrimordial §lHelmet§r, §lPrimordial §lTunic§r, and §lPrimordial §lPants§r.

















    When equipped, this armor set increases the health and saturation provided by consuming raw meat for each piece.
