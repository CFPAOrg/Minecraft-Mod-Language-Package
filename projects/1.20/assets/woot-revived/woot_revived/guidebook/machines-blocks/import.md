# Ingredient Importer

<BlockImage id="import" scale="5" p:attached="true" />

The <ItemImage id="import" scale="0.5"/> Ingredient Importer let you import items or fluids that are needed to spawn the mob

You can either put a chest with the items or a tank with the fluids. Or you can also use
pipes.

Be careful! All the items or fluids that are inserted into the block will be directly destroyed!
You have no way to obtain them back

Don't worry, the block will automatically take what the simulated mobs need to be spawn, no more no less
