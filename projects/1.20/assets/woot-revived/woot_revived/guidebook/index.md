# What is Woot Revived?

Woot Revived introduces a tiered multiblock system that simulates mob kills and delivers drops directly
without spawning any mobs. Build the factory with your fake spawner, add some vitality fuel, maybe
some items you'll need to import, and it will auto generate the loot into your chests.
