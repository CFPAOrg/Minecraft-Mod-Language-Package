	"item.tetra.scroll.art_of_forging.details": "§l§nThe Art of Forging§r\\n Forging, the practice of forming metal into anything you desire. While previously a coveted practice that only the Ancient Smiths and Forge God could partake in, I have discovered a new method of creating your own tools. I release my knowledge onto you, in hopes that you will eventually forge your own masterpieces. \r§l§nFlamberges§r\\n The flamberge. Not only impressive in use of battle but also one of stunning design. It carries the iconic waved blade, perfect for landing a blow that leaves your opponent bleeding. Perhaps of intentional, or unintentional design, one may hone the blade to set enemies ablaze once harmed. \r§l§nHalberds§r\\n A strong, and classic weapon. Used primarily for siege, and for good reason; this weapon combines the traits of a blade, axe, and polearm into one. Best for penetrating the armor of your foes, as well as dismounting and damaging enemies from their mounts. \r§l§nMaces§r\\n Maces; a deadly weapon to any armored opponent. This bludgeoning will ignore armor, leaving devastating blows. At the cost of speed, of course. A nasty weapon to have in your arsenal, a conqueror on the battlefield. \r§l§nDreadnought§r\\n The dreadnought stave is the perfect blend of speed and fury, allowing the ranger to send down a barrage of arrows upon their enemies. Perfect for knocking down those who stand in your way, and perfect for enacting vengeance. This can be used on both standard bows and crossbows. \r§l§nKatana§r\\n A blade hailing from the eastern most corners of this world. The combination of a balanced blade and careful craftsmanship, this blade is suitable for anyone wanting an quality weapon. A katana can cut down anything into shreds and shards. \r§l§nCompound String§r\\n Compound strings, made by twining two bowstrings rather than just one. Although it slows down draw speed, it makes up for it with raw power, giving arrows a harder impact than a typical bowstring. Combining with a dreadnought stave is the perfect combination for ranged warfare. \r§l§nQuarry Hammer§r\\n The hammer has hidden potential within it. By utilizing a specific niche within it, you can unlock the Quarry Hammer. This hammer is ideal for boring tunnels and holes, able to tear up the earth with little effort. If you want a tool that can make quick work of stones and ores, then you have found the perfect item for you. \n§l§nTonal Blade§r\\n A blade, carefully formed with resemblance to an instrument, this weapon makes up for its low damage with it's unique ability. The blade is able to tune into an enemies' resonant frequencies, causing them to be disoriented for quite some time. \r§c§l§nThe Crucible§r\\n §kThe page is incomprehensible and torn. Perhaps something is missing?§r",

	"item.tetra.scroll.otherworldly.details": "§l§nOTHERWORLDLY§r\\n After toying with an abandoned ruined portal, I have managed to find a link between this world and other worlds across this foreign realm of reality.",

	"item.tetra.scroll.true_crucible.details": "§c§l§nThe Crucible§r\\n The Crucible, a powerful blade forged from malice and spite. While a potent weapon on its own, forging it in the same fashion as The Architect did allows the blade to gain esoteric properties, coverting part of it's physical damage into the metaphysical."
