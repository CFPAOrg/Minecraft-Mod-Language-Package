            "text": "Sunfish fry resemble miniature pufferfish, with large pectoral fins, a tail fin, and body spines uncharacteristic of adult sunfish. The ocean sunfish or common mola (Mola mola) is one of the heaviest known bony fishes in the world. A member of the order Tetraodontiformes, which also includes pufferfish, porcupinefish, and filefish, the sunfish shares many traits common to members of this order. Sea jellies and salps, once thought to be the primary prey of sunfish, make up only 15% of a sunfish's diet. Sunfish are generalist predators that consume largely small fishes, fish larvae, squid, and crustaceans. The ocean sunfish, Mola mola, is the type species of the genus. Adult sunfish are vulnerable to few natural predators, but sea lions, killer whales, and sharks will consume them."
