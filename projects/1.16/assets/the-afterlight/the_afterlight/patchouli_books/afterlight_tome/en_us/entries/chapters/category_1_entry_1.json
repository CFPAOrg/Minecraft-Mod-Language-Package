In my studies I've noticed there are special crystals that generate underground in the Overworld. You'll need at least twenty-one of these precious crystals to meet your needs. Although, obtaining more might be helpful later on. Think of these as a crucial ingredient in what must be done next."

This special stone also generates deep underground, and you'll need at least 10 pieces of it to create a portal to the dimension. This block serves as the main ingredient base to the portal block, thus making it very vital. Void rock can also be crafted into void rock bricks, which can be used to create an important altar later on. See the next few chapters for more details."
