In both dimensions, the ores can only be found at deep levels. It is also possible to use enchantments to increase the yield of crystals harvested. The crystals can be used in several recipes."

They share some of the same properties, and were naturally formed the same way, so it is possible that they simply were able to form in both climates in a similar way to each other, making them look exactly the same in shape and property."
