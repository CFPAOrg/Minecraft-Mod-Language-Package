He was attempting to create glyphs, which were magical runes that depicted the elements of the moon. In doing so, he realized that he actually called upon the moon itself."

The Moon was not as much of a friend after all, but a deceiving force that was in reality tricking them into insanity. However, the moonspawn nevertheless unintentionally submitted to the evergrowing madness."

They knew the moon caused the insanity, as it happened only after they began communicating with the moon. Some of these moonspawns thought up a plan to strike back at the moon itself. "

Therefore, they tried out their plan by conducting some of those rituals themselves."
