The process involved using glyphs along with rare materials to forge items. For example, it was a common practice to create powerful swords called Geode Blades through this process using glyphs and crystal shards."

To fuel the process, two radiant shards are used to lend magical power in order to help in the creation of whatever is being forged on the workbench. Each recipe done on the workbench will always require four runes of differing types, though sometimes there are two runes of the same type used in a recipe."
