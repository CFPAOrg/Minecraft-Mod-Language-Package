I discovered another interesting 
animal at midday. Hiking the sides 
of the mountain with fresh 
Trilophosaurus meat, I 
encountered fuzzy dinosaurs 
sleeping on top of one another! 
They have long necks and thin 
snouts filled with sharp teeth, and 
a vibrant orange coat of 
feathers. Knowing instantly it was 
a predatory theropod, I made 
haste to return to my home with my 
haul. I believe the species may be 
Coelophysis bauri, a common fossil 
found in the rocks this place 
would eventually preserve. Since 
the animals I saw were sleeping 
during the day, it may be worth 
searching for them at night to 
see if they are nocturnal!
After watching the lowlands for 
multiple nights, I am quite confident 
the vibrant theropods are 
Coelophysis due to their great 
numbers, and their more frequent 
use of hands to grab food. They 
are indeed nocturnal, likely having 
good night vision thanks to their 
reflective inner eyes which make 
them quite intimidating to see at 
night. They seem to have a degree 
of sociality, not moving in groups 
but tolerating and communicating 
between each other as they 
forage. Neither of the larger non
-dinosaur predators seem to be 
active at this time, so 
Coelophysis's nocturnality is 
probably their way of avoiding 
becoming food!
