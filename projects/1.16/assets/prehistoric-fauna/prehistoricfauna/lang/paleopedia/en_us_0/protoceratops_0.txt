Before my encounter with the 
Pinacosaurus, I was most 
unfortunate enough to encounter 
a herd of Protoceratops in the 
dunes. Despite their small stature, 
these ceratopsians are fiercely 
territorial and charged me before 
I even saw them. While I was able 
to escape, I cannot imagine how 
painful it would be to meet the end 
of its beak. Any observation I do 
in the future must be from afar.

I was lucky enough to spot a 
group of Protoceratops from 
afar! Upon observation, I noticed 
that their eyes seem far more 
adept at a nocturnal lifestyle than 
even those of Velociraptor. After 
a night of observation, they began 
to wander off from where they 
had been eating and began to 
sleep away the day. Looking at 
where they had been, the 
horsetails in the area had been 
broken and eaten away.
