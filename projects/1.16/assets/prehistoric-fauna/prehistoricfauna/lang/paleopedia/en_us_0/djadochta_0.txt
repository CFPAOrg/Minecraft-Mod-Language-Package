Having traveled through Hell 
Creek for who knows how long at 
this point, I've stumbled across 
an anomaly. The forest ended 
abruptly, and there in front of me 
was a desert for as far as my 
eyes could see. There should be 
no deserts this close to Hell 
Creek. I must prepare to explore 
this strange place further.

I debarked on my voyage across 
the sands two days ago. The wind 
has made it nigh impossible to 
learn where I've been and where 
I'm going. Despite this, I have been 
fortunate enough to locate an 
oasis of rivers carved into the 
sand. Observing the plant and 
wildlife here, I am completely 
confused and confounded. 
Somehow, I have found myself in 
what must be the Djadochta 
formation. How could it be next to 
Hell Creek? This denies all known 
science. Something strange is 
afoot. Until I know more though, I 
shall study all that I can.

Plants of Djadochta

Metasequoia
The Metasequoia here differs 
from those in Hell Creek. While 
they tower over everything in Hell 
Creek, they grow no more than 24 
meters tall here. Although I have 
only found living plants in the 
Arroyo, trees remain rare even 
there. Despite this, the 
Metasequoia is by far the most
