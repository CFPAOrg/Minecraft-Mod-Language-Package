As the sun sets, I continue to be 
struck by the beauty and 
strangeness of this place. I have 
been heading south for several 
days now, and the sand has begun 
to turn red. Trees have become 
more common, although water is 
still rare. Animals from the 
Morrison have begun to appear 
less and less, whereas animals 
from the Kayenta have started to 
become frequent. The sun is 
setting against large cliffs 
several miles away. The temporal 
squishing I noticed in the 
Cretaceous appears to be 
present here in the Jurassic as 
well. What has been causing this? 
I must find out.

While wandering Kayenta, I 
discovered the strangest thing. 
Despite me never having ventured 
in this area, a house is here. For 
all this time, I have thought I was 
alone, and yet, here is proof 
that others have traveled here 
like me.

I have located the owner, a man 
named Jefferson. When I asked 
where he came from, he said that 
he could not remember. Everything 
before he heard the calling of 
the stone was a blur for him. Now 
that I think of it, I don't remember 
anything before that fateful day 
either. How bizarre.
