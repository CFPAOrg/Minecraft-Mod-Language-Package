An animal off in the distance had 
garnered my attention. Its general 
appearance was as a theropod, 
which struck me as rather odd, 
since the dinosaur remains I have 
previously dug up from Triassic 
rocks have almost never been 
quite as large-and certainly 
never as robust-as this. Once the 
beast stepped forth from the 
obscuring underbrush and into 
the clearing, it had become easily 
discernible as a plantigrade 
animal-standing flat on its feet, 
instead of on the end of its toes
-which gave away that it was not 
truly a dinosaur to begin with. I 
should have known, but what a 
pleasant surprise: Postosuchus!

I followed it for some time, 
watching as it moved through the 
foliage. Eventually, it crouched 
down and began to move very 
slowly. Worried that it had noticed 
me, I froze, only to realize what it 
was actually doing. Only a few 
meters ahead of it, a 
Desmatosuchus was browsing the 
underbrush. The Postosuchus was 
creeping forward before it 
rushed the Desmatosuchus, and 
was successful in taking down its 
prey. It's fascinating that unlike 
Poposaurus, a pursuit predator, 
Postosuchus has taken a much 
more ambush-centric role in the 
ecosystem.
