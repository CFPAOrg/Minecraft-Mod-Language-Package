While observing a lake at dusk, I 
noticed a black shape moving 
through the water. Believing it was 
a Calsoyasuchus at first, I moved 
back before realizing that the 
shape was all wrong. To my 
surprise, what came out of the 
water was a small protomammal 
with a paddle-like tail. While having 
fur, this semi-aquatic animal is not 
a mammal, but an ancestor of them. 
I believe this to be Kayentatherium. 
While I had thought till now that 
Kayentatherium was a burrower, 
the traits I initially attributed to 
digging instead have aided in it 
being a very good swimmer. 

As I watched it wander around 
shortly on land, it began to chew 
at the bottoms of horsetails. As it 
began, I noticed around me other 
broken and eaten away horsetails 
in the area. Interestingly, they 
don't have canines, but instead 
have long, beaver-like teeth.
