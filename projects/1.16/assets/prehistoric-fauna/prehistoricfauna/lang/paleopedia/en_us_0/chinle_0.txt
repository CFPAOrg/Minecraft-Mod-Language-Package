In my years of exploration
attempting to document these 
strange lands, I have begun to 
feel the toll of all my scars and 
broken bones. For this reason I 
set out from Ischigualasto to find 
a suitably scenic place to rest. 
After many miles I found a chain 
of mountains in a warm, tropical 
region. The trees are 
predominantly of the strange 
Cheirolepid variety, with their 
strange succulent-like foliages, in 
abundances and sizes I could only 
find here. The mountains ring 
around a wide valley landscape to 
the north, crossed with dense 
swamps and wide sand-choked 
lakebeds, which I believe 
represents the creation of the 
great Chinle Group in the American 
southwest. Such lush warm places 
have always been my favorites, 
and although I will continue to 
explore and document, I believe 
this is the last place I will live in.

It is a towering conifer with great 
ridges in its bark, this tree is 
amongst the tallest I've ever seen 
and certainly the heartiest, with a 
trunk a whole three meters 
across. It is absent from the 
mountains but dominate in the 
lowlands, the swamps especially 
being stable enough for them to 
grow to huge sizes over many, 
many years. It contains multiple
