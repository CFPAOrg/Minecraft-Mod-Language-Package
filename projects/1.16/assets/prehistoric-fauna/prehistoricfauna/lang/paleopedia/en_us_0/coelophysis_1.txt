I may be in trouble now. After 
hunting Trilophosaurus before 
dawn, I was approached by a 
Coelophysis hoping to scavenge 
from my food. Spooked, I slashed 
at it to scare it away, but when it 
fought back other individuals 
started to rush towards me! I was 
luckily near the house and ran 
inside, but I now fear I may be 
mobbed if I attempt to leave. I may be 
trapped now. I wonder if this 
behavior was driven by an attempt 
to protect each other, or simply to 
get an easier meal by rushing in 
when food is about to be 
"served"...
