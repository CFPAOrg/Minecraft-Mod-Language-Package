very common. The fronds are wide 
and looping. Chinle is the only 
location where I have discovered 
this plant, which is quite 
fascinating.

Cladophlebis
Cladophlebis is a fern which I 
have long known to be water-
loving but weedy, crowding out 
many other grounds plants and 
being the first to grow when a dry 
wasteland is quenched with water, 
yet strangely in the wet tropical 
Chinle where I would have 
expected it to reach its peak, it is 
of only a moderate abundance and 
does not outgrow the other 
foliage.

Horsetail
An ever-consistent food source 
for animals throughout the ages. 
In Chinle I have finally found a 
relative which was lost in later 
eras, the Neocalamites.

Otozamites
They are spindly Benettitaleans. 
Whenever I see blood on its 
fronds I remember his scream, 
which I have not heard for many 
years now...

Zamites
The tall, hardy Zamites are mostly 
just found in the sandy seasonal 
lake beds. It is a strange place to 
be reminded of my early 
adventures.
