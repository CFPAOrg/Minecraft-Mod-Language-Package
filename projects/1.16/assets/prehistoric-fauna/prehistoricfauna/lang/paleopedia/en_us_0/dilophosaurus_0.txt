Today has been difficult. While I 
was hunting for food, I was 
ambushed by a large theropod. 
Jefferson was able to stab at it 
with his weapon, but it slashed him 
with its claws. We were able to 
fight it off, but just barely. I 
recognized it as a Dilophosaurus 
as it ran into the woods. I don't 
think I'll be able to forget those 
blue crests on its head.

It's been about a week now. I've 
made a near-full recovery. I had 
to go out hunting for the first time 
since the incident. When stalking 
through the forest, I heard 
something large eating nearby. My 
curiosity took the better of me, 
and I approached the sound. 
Through the brush, I discovered 
a Dilophosaurus over a downed 
Sarahsaurus. I wanted to get 
revenge for Jefferson, but I 
didn't have the strength to defeat 
it. For the first time, I feel truly 
angry and vengeful against one 
of these beasts.
