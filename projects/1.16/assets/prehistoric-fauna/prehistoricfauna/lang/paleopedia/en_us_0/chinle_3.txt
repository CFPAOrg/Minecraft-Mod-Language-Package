Neocalamites
Small descendants of the long-
extinct towering Calamites which I 
have so far only heard as 
legends from other explorers, 
Neocalamites are survivors of the 
dangerous Permian, a time I never 
managed to cross, who eked out 
an existence along the riverbanks 
of the Triassic. Though a shadow 
of past sizes, Neocalamites are 
still appreciably tall and hearty. 
Springing up in great densities 
in Chinle's lowlands, I have found 
that they are dense enough to rig 
and carve into a good building 
material.
