When I was lost in the dunes, I was 
extremely fortunate enough to 
have found a herd of these 
ankylosaurid dinosaurs. My best 
guess is that these would be 
Pinacosaurus. Being weary and 
dehydrated from the hot desert 
sun, I collapsed on its back and 
passed out. When I awoke, I had 
arrived here at the Arroyo.

As the days passed, I stayed near 
the Pinacosaurus herd. They seem 
to love the horsetails that grow 
here. At times, I've seen smaller 
animals, such as Telmasaurus and 
Velociraptor, catch rides on the 
Pinacosaurus, similar to what I did. 
At night, they all hunker down and 
sleep until dawn.

Unlike the Ankylosaurus of Hell 
Creek, Pinacosaurus is far more 
docile. Whilst they still are highly 
willing to attack anything that 
comes near their young, I am able 
to safely approach a lone 
Pinacosaurus.
