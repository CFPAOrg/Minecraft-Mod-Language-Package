While observing the Sarahsaurus, 
I noticed a bulky shape pushing 
through the underbrush. An 
armored creature with horns like 
a dragon on its head was 
lumbering towards some 
clathopteris growing nearby. I was 
able to identify the creature as a 
Scelidosaurus. It was extremely 
interesting to watch walking, as 
there have been tracks attributed 
to Scelidosaurus showing it as 
capable of both bipedal and 
quadrupedal movement. While it's 
only a meter tall, it is related to 
the much larger Ankylosaurus and 
Stegosaurus.

While observing more 
Scelidosaurus, I noticed a 
Dilophosaurus charging toward 
them. Despite only having ever 
seen Scelidosaurus walk on all 
four legs, they ran on only their 
hind two! They were able to 
escape the Dilophosaurus, and 
when I found them again, all had 
gone back to their quadrupedal 
posture. Their locomotion is truly 
astounding!
