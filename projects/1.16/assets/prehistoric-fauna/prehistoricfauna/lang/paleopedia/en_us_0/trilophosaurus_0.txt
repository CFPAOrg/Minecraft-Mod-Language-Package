On my second day surveying the 
forested mountains for a location 
to build, I was startled to find the 
brush beneath me moving. After a 
few minutes of tracking the 
direction of the motion, I found it 
to be an Allokotosaur! It was 
superficially lizard-like, stopping 
to rest as it observed me from a 
distance, and walked away again 
probably looking for a safer place 
to eat. I believe it is of the genus 
Trilophosaurus, based on its very 
long tail.

During my treks through the 
swamplands, I have regularly 
found that as a way to retreat 
from predators, and me, the 
Trilophosaurus climb Neocalamites 
for safety! They are adept 
climbers generally, their claws and 
legs allowing them to cling tightly 
to the stems. They stand on top of 
the Neocalamites out of reach of 
danger, and climb down as soon as 
the threat is gone. Because of 
this, I choose to attack them in the 
evening, when they are all asleep. 
The meat is quite tasty, like 
poultry.
