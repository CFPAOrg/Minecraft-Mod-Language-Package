very similar species, some 
relatives of Araucaria, some being 
Cheirolepids.

Woodworthia
These trees are common in the 
mountains, and are very peculiar. 
The wildfires which plague the 
land affect their growth harshly: 
lower branches are burnt away 
and scar with thick woody knobs 
which come to cover their long, 
thin trunks. Their hardy 
Cheirolepid foliage is wonderfully 
vibrant.

Schilderia
On the rare occasions I find this 
tree, it puts me in awe. They are of 
a medium height, outcompeted by 
the other trees yet nothing to 
sneeze at, but their true wonder 
is in their width. The dark foliage 
has many long upwards facing 
limbs, like an immense artichoke, 
stretching the tree into a girth 
like a great castle. When I felled 
one, the wood surprised me with 
its vibrant magenta hue! I have 
taken great pride in the beautiful 
rocking chairs I have carved 
from it.

Clathropteris
Very common ferns, with long 
fronds radiating off the top of a 
long thin stem.

Phlebopteris
Quite akin to the related 
Clathropteris, and also
