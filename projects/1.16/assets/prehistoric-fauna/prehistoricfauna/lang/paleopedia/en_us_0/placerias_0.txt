Although I selected the mountains 
as a home due to considering the 
dangers of flooding, they do 
present problems in their wildlife, 
namely, Placerias. They are 
relatives of the Ischigualastia to 
the south, with more prominent 
tusks and colorful fleshy faces. 
They are herding animals which 
prefer the uplands, and are quite 
dangerous, because of how readily 
they will attack a threat to any 
member of the group. Their strong 
beaks and bulk always make me 
worry about my body language in 
front of them. This is not helped 
by the fact that they sleep on 
random brief shifts throughout the 
day, so the herds are never 
wholly fast asleep. Because of 
them I have built my timber home 
on stilts to keep out of their way, 
so I hope they will not disturb the 
stilts in any way. To say the least, 
my favorable views of these 
beautiful animals have steadily 
waned. I should also mention that 
being a staple food source in this 
ecosystem, they attract 
predators...
