While I was washing in one of the 
rivers, I saw a most astonishing 
sight! A herd of visiting 
Plesiohadros had begun to eat 
young Trochodendroides saplings 
along the edge of the water! While 
they have never been found 
directly in the Djadochta fossil 
record, I had theorized for years 
that they may have traveled here 
from time to time from nearby 
locations. This encounter proves 
my theory correct!

Whilst observing the herd, I 
noticed them becoming aggressive 
and they began bellowing at me 
whenever I got too close to 
their young. They aren't 
territorial with me, but like 
most animals here, are very 
wary when it comes to their 
children. It's truly fascinating to 
see these hadrosaurs here!
