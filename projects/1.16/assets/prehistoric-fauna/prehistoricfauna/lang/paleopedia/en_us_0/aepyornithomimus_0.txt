While studying the horsetails that 
grow here, I stumbled upon a 
flock of Aepyornithomimus! A flock 
of seven were eating away at 
Cobbania growing along the shore 
before they noticed me. 
Interestingly, they all ran in a 
group from me, rather than 
scampering off into different 
directions like other animals I've 
encountered.

These feathered theropods 
belong to a group known as 
ornithomimids, or bird-mimics. Their 
behavior reminded me of birds 
back home flying away when 
children came near them. After 
several hours of cautious 
observation, several fell asleep, 
while others stayed awake for 
several more hours. I believe that 
they are cathemeral, and don't 
necessarily sleep on any form of 
schedule.
