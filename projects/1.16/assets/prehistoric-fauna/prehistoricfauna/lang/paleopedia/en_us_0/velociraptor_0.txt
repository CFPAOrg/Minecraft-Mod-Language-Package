I was not the only creature who 
joined the Pinacosaurus on their 
journey across the dunes. A small 
dromaeosaur rode on another 
Pinacosaurus nearby. I gave it 
some of my meat rations one night, 
and it has stayed close to me 
ever since. I quite like my new 
companion. I believe I shall name 
him Manfredd.

Unlike the larger Dakotaraptors of 
Hell Creek, Velociraptor seems to 
be much more of a curious and 
friendly animal. That is not to say 
though that it will not attack.

While observing a group of 
Protoceratops with Manfredd, they 
noticed me! I was unprepared for 
a Protoceratops charge, and 
prepared for its beak, but it 
never came. Manfredd had 
stepped in front of me, and that 
seemed to give the Protoceratops 
pause. The Protoceratops seem 
unwilling to approach 
Velociraptors. Truly fascinating!
