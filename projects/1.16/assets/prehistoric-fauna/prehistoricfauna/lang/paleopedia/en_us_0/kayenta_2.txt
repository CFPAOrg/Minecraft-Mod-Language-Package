Otozamites
These scrubs of varying heights 
are making up much of the 
underbrush. The fronds are thin 
and very yellow, and have spindly 
stems which prop their foliages up 
above the Laurozamites.

Clathropteris
I would never have expected a 
fern such as this to hold on in the 
dry Kayenta terrain, but here it is 
rising out of the undergrowth of 
Brachyphyllum woodlands. The wide 
looping fronds are ones I know to 
be water-lovers from lusher 
forests. I thus suspect the wet 
season will miraculously bring 
enough water for them to survive 
the dry season.

Zamites
The bigger cousins of Otozamites 
are ones I am quite familiar with 
from my time in the Morrison. Even 
at Kayentas most barren on the 
red paved deserts, Zamites stand 
tall against the harsh flat land 
where no other tree could. Really 
a marvel.

Horsetails
As always, horsetails peek 
themselves out of any place with 
water, Kayenta being no exception. 
Though less common than other 
similarly dry lands they are 
frequent sights. Many critters 
seem to enjoy these.
