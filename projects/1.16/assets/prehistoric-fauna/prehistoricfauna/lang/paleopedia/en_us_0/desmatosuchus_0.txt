After roughly a week surveying 
the mountain range, I descended 
into the swampy basin. For a long 
time the forests seemed very 
quiet, until the bushes moved in 
front of me to reveal a wide 
brown figure: a Desmatosuchus! I 
recognized it instantly thanks to 
its long, curved spikes on its 
shoulder. Backing up to a 
distance, I eventually observed 
the animal shoveling through dirt 
with its nose to find mushrooms to 
eat. I considered taking the fruits 
of its labor for my own dinner but 
the spikes helped to dissuade me! I 
do not expect these animals to 
have many predators thanks to 
their large size and heavy armor.

Inspired by the peculiar 
rectangular osteoderms and 
spines I had seen on 
Desmatosuchus, I premeditated a 
hunting expedition. Stalking a 
target, I eventually found the 
right vantage point and brought it 
down with arrows aimed at careful 
locations. After bringing it down, I 
cut away the most edible cuts of 
meat, some of the osteoderms, and 
the spikes. Once home, I attached 
the osteoderms and spikes with 
osteoderms I had already 
obtained from Typothorax, and 
created a chestplate from the 
armor! The spikes I fixed to the 
shoulders of the armor make it 
wonderfully strange and sharp 
looking.
