As I wandered through the forest, 
a head rose from the brush. The 
creature lifted its head to the 
same height as mine, despite its 
body being much lower. This 
interesting creature was the 
basal sauropodomorph 
Sarahsaurus, I believe. Despite 
being no taller than me, 
Sarahsaurus is a relative to the 
giant sauropods like Camarasaurus 
and Brachiosaurus. It's truly 
fascinating to see sauropods 
when they're at this scale. I tried 
to approach, but as I got closer, 
it arose and stood on its hind legs, 
unlike its quadrupedal relatives. 
Truly fascinating!

I decided to stay back and 
observe it for as long as I could. 
After a few moments of it warily 
watching me, it began to browse 
again. Watching it eat, it moved 
from otozamites to otozamites, 
stripping the leaves from the 
stems. While it did browse, it also 
used its long neck to reach up 
trees and eat the leaves from the 
higher branches. More research 
must be done on its eating habits.
