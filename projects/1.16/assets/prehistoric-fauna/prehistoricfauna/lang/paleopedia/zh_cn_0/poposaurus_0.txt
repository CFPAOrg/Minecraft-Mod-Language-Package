While documenting the mountain, I 
was able to witness something 
amazing. A large, bipedal reptile 
was chasing down a Placerias in 
the distance! I must assume that 
this was Poposaurus! It ran after 
the lone Placerias, and soon had 
caught up and subdued its prey. 
Watching these prehistoric animals 
hunt is always fascinating, so long 
as it's from afar!

On my way home today, I stumbled 
upon a Poposaurus! Luckily for me, 
it was asleep, hinting towards a 
Cathemeral sleep cycle, as the 
sun was only at noon. While it was 
lucky for me that the Poposaurus 
was asleep this time, I must be 
more careful when traversing the 
area in the future.
