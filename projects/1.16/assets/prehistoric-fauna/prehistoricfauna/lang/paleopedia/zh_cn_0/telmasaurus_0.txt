Whilst observing a nest, I noticed 
something watching me. A monitor-
like lizard sat on the other side 
of the nest, staring at me. For a 
while, we just watched each other, 
with the eggs between us. I 
identified the lizard to be a 
Telmasaurus. I knew that these 
eggs belonged to a nearby Citipati 
couple, so what was it doing here? 
As I sat pondering this, the 
Telmasaurus flashed forward and 
scooped one of the eggs into its 
mouth before running away. At 
that moment, I realized exactly 
what was happening. The 
Telmasaurus eats other animals' 
eggs!

While going on a stroll through the 
arroyo today, I accidentally 
stepped on a Telmasaurus! In 
retaliation, the Telmasaurus spun 
around and bit my ankle before 
scampering off into the brush. 
Similar to some modern-day 
monitors, Telmasaurus seems to 
possess a venomous bite. I do not 
know if it is deadly, as I was able 
to brew some horsetail tea in time 
to battle the venom.
