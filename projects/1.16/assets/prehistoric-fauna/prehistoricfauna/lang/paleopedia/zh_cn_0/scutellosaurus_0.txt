While burying Jefferson, I was 
joined by several small armored 
dinosaurs. I recognized them 
instantly as Scutellosaurus. While 
normally I would be fascinated, 
this did little to alleviate the mood. 
As they day drew on, they did 
begin to draw more and more of 
my attention. Despite being related 
to giants like Ankylosaurus, 
Scutellosaurus is less than 2 
meters in length. They seemed to 
congregate around a Clathopteris, 
nibbling the leaves on it. I will have 
to observe them more, when my 
mood is better.

While walking today, I saw another 
Sarahsaurus. Interestingly, a 
group of Scutellosaurus following 
after, staying as close as they 
seemingly could to it. It was as if 
they knew that they were safer 
around this bigger herbivore. I 
followed for a short while, and 
wherever the Sarahsaurus went, 
the Scutellosaurus were close 
behind. When a couple 
Megapnosaurus began 
approaching, the Scutellosaurus 
huddled together behind the 
Sarahsaurus, which subsequently 
spooked the Megapnosaurus away.
