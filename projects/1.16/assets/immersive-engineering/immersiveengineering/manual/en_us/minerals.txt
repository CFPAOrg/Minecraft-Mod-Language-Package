Mineral Deposits
Oresome
The deposits of Ore found around your world are nothing new to you. What you have so far left out of consideration though are mineral veins, which contain a mix of different ores. Due to their wide and thin spread, the average miner can't find them, but a <link;excavator;special machine> might be able to assist with that.
<&survey_tools>To begin looking for mineral veins, you'll want to craft some §2Survey Tools§r. By venturing out and using these tools on various blocks of natural soil, you can identify veins and find their approximate positions.

Each sample you take of the same vein gets you a more accurate read on what it contains and where it origi- nates. Note that veins can overlap, so you may find traces of different veins quite close to each other.

<&sample_drill>After narrowing down the type and position of the vein, use a §2Core Sample Drill§r to get a precise read on what veins are found at an exact position.
Supply the machine with power and rightclick it or use redstone to activate it. The drill consumes <config;i;machines.coredrill.consumption> Flux/t to then extract a core sample at its location which provides detailed information on the mineral vein.

<&core_sample>The sample will not only tell you exactly what minerals are found there, including their relative presence, but also their individual §2saturation§r. A higher saturation means a higher chance for an excavator to fill its bucket wheel.

Sneak + rightclick a core sample to place it in the world, allowing you to read its position and information. Additionally, when placed, you can rightclick it with a map in order to mark its original position on there.

The following pages list every type of vein and the ores that can be retrieved from them.
