Revolver Cartridges

Cartridges are created in the Engineer's Workbench, by the use of specific <link;blueprints;Engineer's Blueprints>. Blueprints for normal ammunition you can create yourself, but some more advanced types will require you to buy adequate blueprints from someone else.<np>
<&empty>§lEmpty §lCasings§r and §lShells§r are the basis for every projectile. Empty Casings can also be crafted in the <link;metal_press;Metal Press>, using the appropriate mold, at a greatly reduced cost.<np>
<&casull>§lCasull §lCartridges§r are created with a "Common Projectiles" blueprint. They are a simple lead projectile inflicting medium damage.<np>
<&ap>§lArmor-Piercing §lCartridges§r are created with the same blueprint. They do the same amount of damage but penetrate armor by sheer kinetic force.<np>
<&buckshot>§lBuckshot §lCartridges§r, created with the aformentioned blueprint, are filled with multiple small projectiles that are fired out in a cone shape. This cartridge is highly effective at short range.<np>
<&he>§lHigh-Explosive §lCartridges§r are created with a "Common Projectiles" blueprint. They fire a projectile that explodes on impact, causing damage to living creatures and terrain.<np>
<&silver>§lSilver §lCartridges§r, also created with a "Common Projectiles" blueprint, consist of a lead core wrapped in silver, making them highly effective against undead.<np>
<&dragon>§lDragon's §lBreath Cartridges§r are created with a "Specialized Projectiles" blueprint. Similarly to Buckshot, they are effective at short range, but instead of small metal shots, they are filled with a flammable metal dust, creating a blast of flame.<np>
<&potion>§lPhial §lCartridges§r are also created with a "Specialized" blueprint. They can be filled with any potion by crafting them together in a crafting grid and this potion will then be applied on impact. Normal potions require a direct hit, splash potions have an area of effect and Lingering Potions will create a temporary, lingering potion cloud.<np>
<&flare>§lFlare §lCartridges§r are created with a "Specialized" blueprint. When fired, the flare explodes after a certain distance and then slowly sinks to the ground. You can combine the cartridge with dyes in a crafting table to change its colour.<np>
<&homing>§lHoming §lCartridges§r are created with a "Specialized Projectiles" blueprint. Using the intriguing properties of an Eye of Ender, these projectiles gain the ability to seek out and chase the closest target.
<&wolfpack>§lWolfpack §lCartridges§r are created with the same blueprint and consist of a collection of multiple homing shots in a single shell. The initial projectile is unguided, but on impact, it splits into six target seeking shots that shred surrounding enemies.
