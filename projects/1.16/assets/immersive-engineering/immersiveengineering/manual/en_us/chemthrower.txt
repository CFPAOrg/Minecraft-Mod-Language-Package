Chemical Thrower
BURN ALL THE THINGS!
The Chemical Thrower is a device that propels fluids from its internal tank. The device can be loaded with any fluid, liquid or gas, and, on right click, will spray it out.
It also features a function to ignite the fluid, if it is flammable. To toggle the pilot light, sneak and rightclick.
Like some other tools, the chemical thrower can be modified in the <link;workbench;Engineer's Workbench>. These upgrades affect the size of the tank, range and spread.

<&large>The §2Large Tank§r increases the fluid capacity of the Chemical Thrower by 2000 mb.
<&focus>The §2Focused Nozzle§r decreases the spread of fluids sprayed out and also slightly increases their range, allowing you to hit further targets with more precision.
<&multi>The §2Multitank§r allows the Chemthrower to store up to three different Fluids. You can select the active tank by <config;b;tools.chemthrower.scroll;sneaking and using the scrollwheel, or through use of;using> the keybind §l<keybind;key.immersiveengineering.chemthrowerSwitch>§r if it has been set in the options.
This upgrade is mutually exclusive to the §2Large Tank§r.
