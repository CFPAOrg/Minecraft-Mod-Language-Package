Improved Blast Furnace
Industrialized Refinement
<&brick_recipe>The Improved Blast Furnace is a much more professional way of <link;crude_blast_furnace;creating steel;>. Not only does it allow the automation of in- and outputs, it can also be outfitted with preheaters to speed up the refinement process by addition of hot air.
The furnace is made from reinforced bricks, so you'd be advised to spend your first batches of steel on this upgrade.
<&multiblock>The structure of the Furnace is similar to its crude predecessor, but the bricks have been reinforced and a hopper was added at the top to funnel in the inputs. Steel is output at the front of the furnace, slag at the back, and the furnace will automatically output to connected inventories or conveyor belts. Iron and Coal Coke are fed in through the top.<np>
<&preheater>Blast Furnace Preheaters are used to heat up air and then blow it into the furnace to speed up the refinement process of iron. Each furnace can have up to two preheaters connected to the ports on the each side, and each preheater requires <config;i;machines.preheater_consumption> Flux/t to operate.
