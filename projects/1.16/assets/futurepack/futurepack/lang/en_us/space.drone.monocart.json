	"The monocart can be placed with a contruction box on top of a monorail, and can be teared off with a scrench.",
	"With the button at the top right corner I can switch between route and inventory view. Next to the button is an energy bar.",

	"If there are more waypoints than can be displayed on one page, then a yellow scroll bar appears on the right.",
	"Inventory view:",
	"To increase range and energy storage, I added the upper slots for batteries and energy cells, allowing the monocart to be charged if the internal energy amount becomes too low.",
	"Below are the 27 freight slots for monocarts."
