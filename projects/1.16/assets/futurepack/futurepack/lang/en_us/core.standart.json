	"Processors possess 1 critical property: Their capacity (§lCore§r), which indicates the maximum load (refer to Chipsets and Memory entries for more information) that the processor can handle before it begins to heat up. When the temperature exceeds a core's maximum operating temperature, it'll fry up!"
