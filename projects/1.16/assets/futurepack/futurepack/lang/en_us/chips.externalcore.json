  "The possibilities of \"Overclocking\" are limited and are only applicable to blocks with a computer system. With the help of nanostructure manipulation, I can manipulate any block that performs a task (ticking tileEntity) to add additional work steps.",
  "To do this, I have developed a machine that can be placed upon other blocks. It has an internal computer system and needs a source of neon energy to function. A single external processing unit at a RAM value of 100% doubles the speed of the block.",
