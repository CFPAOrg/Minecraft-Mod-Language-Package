  "The range of an antenna depends on the number of connected metal blocks and the number of metal blocks of the receiving antenna.",

  "I noticed that I have to send signals over great distances. If I had to use network cables for this I would need a vast amount of resources.",
  "Which is why I developed a laser that is capable of transmitting signals over a distance of 1024 meters. Since I have also to be able to respond in a network transmitter and receiver are integrated in one block.",
  "Originally I wanted to use ultra violet light for the data transfer but the atmospheric deflection was too great and I had to use infrared light.",

  },
  "For the laser to work (also over long distances) transmitter and receiver have to be exactly on one line."
