  "By modifying a laser diode with a precision focus lens, I can specifically manipulate the output beam to achieve specific and potentially stronger effects.",
  "The red focus lens modifies the laser so that it generates a lot of heat upon impact. This lens is ideal for killing and cutting objects.",
  "Focus lenses require a very precise manufacturing process, which can only be ensured by the neon industrial furnace.",
