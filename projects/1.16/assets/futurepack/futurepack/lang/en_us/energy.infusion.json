	"The local crystals can cause considerable damage to biological organisms. During further analysis I noticed that the crystals have a special interaction with organic materials. In this process the organic structures as well as the crystal structures degenerate, this causes the emission of some energy.",
	"Using this principle I designed a generator which injects crystal fragments into food or burnable materials (not Lava or Coal). The produced heat can simply be cast into neon energy. As a waste product the machine produces a fine Neon Crystal Dust.",

	"The amount of energy depends on: The value of Industrial Chipsets, the type of the crystal and the food/fuel value of the organic substance.",
	"By increasing the \"ram\"-value I can cause a faster generation and emission of the energy.",
