  "Using my Centrifuge, I can process remnants of plants and other organic material to extract traces of more valuable materials found inside them.",
  "In particular, after processing, the following residual elements are collected:",
  "Woodchips: combustible wood residue",
  "Compost: plant residue, used as a fertilizer",
  "Plant fibers: raw material for Biopolymer",
  "I can use this method on dirt and a wide variety of plants; but for plants containing any dye, I need a better process.",
  "Example:",
