	"Drones need an base to load energy and exchange items. So I designed the Drone Station. On their top I am able to place drones.",
	"The Drone Station contains an large inventory (at top) and an battery bar (at bottom). I must add at least one battery to power the drones.",
	"The inventory can be filled and emptied by the use of pipes/hopper. By connecting a cable, the batteries can charge automatically.",
