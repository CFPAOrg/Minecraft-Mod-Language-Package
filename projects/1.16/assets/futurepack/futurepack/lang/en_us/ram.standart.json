	"By combining Neon parts which store small amounts of energy as well as a control device, I have designed a memory storage device. I built the controller out of a silicon wafer coated with iron.",
	"This memory design is very fast, but the data must be rewritten periodically. This is caused by a slow energy leak of the small storages.",

	"RAM units possess 2 critical properties: Their speed (§lram§r), which tells the general speed  of the system (refer Mainboard), and their cost (§lcorepower§r), which tells the performance needed from the processor."
