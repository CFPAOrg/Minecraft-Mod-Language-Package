    "Sometimes I want to overclock my computers far more than what I am currently able to do. The ambient coolers are not able to support this level of overclocking and can take up a lot of room. To increase the capacity of my machiens without them overheating, I invented an active water-based cooling system.",
    "Since water boils at 100°C, steam generation and subsequent cooling only occur when the connected computer system reaches this point, also saving energy and resources.",

	"I can place water buckets into the cooler directly, load them using item pipes, or provide water from pipes. However, steam is emitted from the top, so I can only work with inputs and outputs from the sides."
