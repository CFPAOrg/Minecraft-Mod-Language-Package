You can however expose the PCB for a shorter time, which will result in a lower chance of the PCB successfully being etched.$(p)Note that exposure progress is faster when the total progress is lower, and slower toward the end."

In this mode, the threshold is fixed to 25% + 5% per signal level (although a signal of 0 disables the machine, so 30%-100% in effect).$(p)This may be handy if you want to set the threshold of many lightboxes at once."
