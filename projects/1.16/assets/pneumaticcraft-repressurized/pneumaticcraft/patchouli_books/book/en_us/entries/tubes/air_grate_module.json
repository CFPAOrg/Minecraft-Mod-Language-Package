With positive $(l:base_concepts/pressure)pressure/$, the tube will blow entities away and with $(thing)negative/$ pressure it will suck entities towards it. Negative pressure is achieved with a $(l:machines/vacuum_pump)Vacuum Pump/$. When item entities are close enough, they will automatically be inserted into any adjacent inventory, respecting sided inventories (like Furnaces)."
