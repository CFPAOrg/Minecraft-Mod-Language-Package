It uses $(l:base_concepts/pressure)pressure/$ to decrease the density of a liquid to force it upwards.$(p)When pressurized, it extrudes $(l:components/drill_pipe)Drill Pipes/$ (which you must provide) downwards until it hits any liquid, at which point it will pump it. This makes it perfect for $(l:base_concepts/oil)Oil/$ extraction, as Oil might be deep underground."

Breaking blocks uses up air; this is a very small amount for soft blocks like dirt or sand, but much more for hard blocks such as obsidian.$(p)The air usage required to pump fluids scales linearly with the depth it is pumping at, i.e. the number of $(item)Drill Pipes/$ currently extruded."

This is useful when pumping for a certain liquid, to make sure no other liquids will be pumped."
