Therefore, this module is best used in conjunction with the $(l:tubes/pressure_gauge_module)Pressure Gauge Module/$, which can emit redstone to turn compressors off."

You can set a precise threshold in the GUI, or with the $(bold)Advanced Config/$ checkbox, configure interpolated threshold levels based on the signal. This functions very much like the $(l:tubes/pressure_gauge_module#img)Pressure Gauge GUI/$, but in reverse."
