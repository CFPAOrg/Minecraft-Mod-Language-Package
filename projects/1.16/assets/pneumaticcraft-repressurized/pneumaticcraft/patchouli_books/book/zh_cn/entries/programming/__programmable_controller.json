A program can be written in a $(l:programming/programmer)Programmer/$, and saved to either a $(item)Drone/$ or $(l:components/network_components#network_api)Network API/$. Either of these items can then be placed in the $(item)Programmable Controller/$. Provided that there is enough $(l:base_concepts/pressure)pressure/$, the $(item)Programmable Controller/$ will execute the program just as it would when programmed onto a $(item)Drone/$. "

It's not a real entity, so no pathfinding is involved, and the $(thing)minidrone/$ can move through walls. This has the benefit of being more friendly to the server and more reliable in general.$(li)When executing a program, the $(item)Programmable Controller/$ will use air at a rate of 10mL/tick (whereas Drones only use 1mL/tick)."
