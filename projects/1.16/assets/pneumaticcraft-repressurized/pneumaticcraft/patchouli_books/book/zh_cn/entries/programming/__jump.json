If it fails for any reason, execution will return to the $(l:programming/start)Start/$ widget. (This fallback behaviour should never occur normally)."

A useful tip is to check $(bold)Show Flow/$ checkbox at the bottom left of the $(l:programming/programmer)Programmer/$ GUI;  it will show lines linking $(thing)Jump/Condition/Label/$ widgets of the same name."
