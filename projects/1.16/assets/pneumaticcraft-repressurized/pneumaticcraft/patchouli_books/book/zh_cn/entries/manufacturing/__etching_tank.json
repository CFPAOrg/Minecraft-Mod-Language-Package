      "text": "Without $(l:base_concepts/heat)Heat/$, the Etching Tank takes 150 seconds to fully etch a PCB (although of course it can etch up to 25 in parallel). If you apply heat to the tank, you can further reduce the processing time, down to a minimum of 30 seconds; the hotter the tank gets, the faster the processing time. However, be warned that when heated, a small amount of Etching Acid will be used up while PCB's are being etched."
