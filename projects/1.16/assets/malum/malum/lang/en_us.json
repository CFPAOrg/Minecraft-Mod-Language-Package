  "malum.gui.book.page.arcane_spirit": "Arcane spirit is the purest, most common form of spirit magics. This rather simple spirit is found within all sorts of creatures, there's 2 criteria. A given soul can either be born from magic, or actively use magic. Think of a skeleton or a witch.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.arcane_spoil_ring": "Harvesting spirits may often yield insufficient result, even after a long night of hunting you might not have enough spirit spoils for your needs. The ring of arcane spoils will increase how many spirits you get from spirit harvesting.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.arcane_spoil_ring_2": "This ring may bring up a good question, \"How can a soul shatter into more spirits than it holds\". Souls overtime adapt into the body they're placed into and therefore in a way 'grow spirits', using magic we can greatly accelerate this process. To put it nicely, the soul will be upset.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.awakened_tyrving": "The awakened tyrving is an even stronger form of the tyrving. More features are planned for this sword so, expect some more cool text here! <3",
  "malum.gui.book.page.basics_of_magic": "Within our realm exists an arcane phenomenon known as spirits. Spirits are a magical resource found primarily within a soul, the magical representation of a living being. Inside a soul they exist as a form of essence, well versed warlocks know it as \"essentia\".",
  "malum.gui.book.page.basics_of_magic_2": "This essence is not enough for magics however, we can't utilize it until it's in a more physical state. Spirit magics are only accessible through an item form of spirits, known as a spirit splinter. Greater means of processing spirits through refining raw essence may be possible however.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.basics_of_magic_3": "Like previously mentioned, spirits reside within souls. Which spirits a given soul contains determines on 2 things, the environment around the body and gathered expertise on various things. For example, a nether-born being would inherently have infernal spirit in their soul.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.basics_of_magic_4": "A dedicated magic practitioner who has spent time mastering magics would have their soul develop arcane spirit parallel to their gathered wisdom. A witch is a good example of this. As your body and mind develops, your soul does just the same.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.blazing_quartz": "The nether is a strange place, there are many things found within that seemingly escape the realm of plausibility. It's hard to tell if it's due to natural or magical causes. The entirety of the nether could've been the work of just one warlock with way too much free time.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.blazing_quartz_2": "Regardless of why it's so bizarre, there are many handy resources found inside. One that you may not be familiar with is blazing quartz, an inferno infused form of quartz. It works wonders as a fuel source.",

  "malum.gui.book.page.creating_runes": "Utilizing the rune table once more, we can create runes. A rune is a magical basis for spells, it can be shaped into an Effect Rune or Amplifier Rune. Assembling runes together at a rune table will allow you to make Spell Runes. This spell system is yet to be implemented.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.curios": "The two spirit metals, hallowed gold and soul stained steel can be turned into quite a few gilded or ornate trinkets. They're simple curios that provide a small boost to your defense and toughness, they also function as a basis for spirit infusion.",

  "malum.gui.book.page.earthen_spirit": "Earthen spirit represents nature, some select natural lifeforms all bear earthen spirit in their soul. Earthen spirit presence is most commonly connected with some form of growth or life, like cows producing milk or sheep growing wool.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.eldritch_spirit": "The deeper you dive into various obscurities and phenomenon that seem completely separate from spirit magics, the more you realize how intertwined everything is. The strange, visitors per say all contain eldritch spirit.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.ether": "Long gone are the days of nitor, however ether is much the same. It's a partially-translucent magic matter that looks much like fire and shines even brighter. It can be put on a torch or placed in a tainted rock brazier. It can also be colored using most dyes.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.hallowed_gold": "Opposite of soul stained steel, hallowed gold is a very versatile holy metal meant for various arcane mechanisms and utilities.

  "malum.gui.book.page.rune_table": "The rune table is a multi-block designed for simple and quick combining of items and spirits. It has three slots for ingredients, one on each of it's three parts. Assembling things together requires a rite of assembly to be performed nearby.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.runewood_trees": "Spirit magics aren't limited just to souls and spirits, through a rare and unforeseen string of events a new type of tree was born. It's hard to tell how it first grew, overexposure to arcane spirit magic might be the most plausible scenario.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.runewood_trees_2": "Runewood trees are an odd mixture of arcane spirit combined with what used to be a large oak tree. Due to this, runewood is a perfect basis for magic and is the basis of many arcane devices and various ritualistic appliances. Processing it in a furnace also yields a special, arcane charcoal.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.sacred_spirit": "Sacred spirit is a symbol of the living, it pains wicked beings such as zombies or skeletons. It is a direct opposite of the undead, found only in pure and untainted souls. It yields many curative properties",
  "malum.gui.book.page.sacrificial_dagger": "A scythe is a very efficient tool at cutting through hordes of enemies. However, this perk may often become a detriment in certain situations.

  "malum.gui.book.page.solar_sap": "Solar Sap is a magical substance found naturally within runewood. Overtime as the tree grew more magical and abstract it developed this partially arcane sap. It's a very delicate, thick substance with extraordinary rejuvenating properties.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.solar_sap_2": "Gathering this sap is a rather mundane process. First, the runewood bark must be stripped off of a log. If sap is exposed it then needs to be collected using a glass container, resulting in bottled solar sap.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.solar_sap_3": "You may heat up bottled sap to turn it into solar syrup, a delicious substance that will instantly recover health as well as grant a regenerative effect. Sapballs can also be made from solar sap, they're a more efficient form of slimeballs.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.soul_stained_steel": "Soul Stained Steel is a very strong magical metal perfect for creating strong tools, armor and various trinkets. The wicked metal is a successor to iron combined with wicked magics.",

  "malum.gui.book.page.spirit_harvesting": "The scythe is a strong weapon designed for dealing with large groups of enemies at a time. It is extremely powerful at doing just that, unparalleled to any other weapon. The simplest scythe is made with iron and soulstone.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.spirit_harvesting_2": "Scythes aren't limited to just being a weapon however. Due to soulstone, scythes are able to harm both the body and the soul at the same time. When a soul \"dies\" alongside it's body, it is shattered. Soul shattering is the simplest way to obtain spirits.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.spirit_infusion": "The Spirit Altar is an essential altar meant for creating various complexities, components and magics. The altar uses a prime item, spirits and occasionally extra side-items placed on nearby item pedestals or stands. This arcane process is known as spirit infusion.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.spirit_infusion_2": "Spirit infusion is a rather long process, it starts with a prime item placed right in the middle of your spirit altar. This item will be the center of your infusion, all extra spirits and items needed will be fused into the prime item. Spirits are also placed directly in the altar, surrounding the prime item.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.spirit_infusion_3": "It is very important to understand the difference between spirits and items in this process. When supplied with a valid combination of prime item and spirits, the altar will start the infusion process. It will soon enough look and collect nearby items from valid item providers.",

  "malum.gui.book.page.spirit_resonators": "As you delve deeper into spirit tinkering, you'll need more complex composite ingredients for your infusions and crafts. Spirit resonators serve as a 'link' of sorts, they allow a mechanism or magic practitioner to work with spirits on a further level.",

  "malum.gui.book.page.stronghold_armor": "The Soul Stained Stronghold Armor Set is a perfect mix between magical and metallurgic strength. The set provides tons of resilience to it's bearer. It also grants knockback immunity.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.tainted_rock": "One of the simplest infusions known results in tainted rock. The process is known as animating stone and can be performed likewise on granite, diorite and andesite. Infusing cobblestone with sacred and arcane spirit will yield tainted rock.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.tainted_rock_architecture": "Using a crafting table or the stone cutter, you can make many variants of tainted rock.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.totem_magic": "Totem magic is a subtype of spirit magic specifically revolving around ritual like effects and designs. These rituals are known as spirit rites, alternatively totem rites. Each spirit rite is represented by a list of spirits.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.totem_magic_2": "To perform a spirit rite you must engrave these spirits onto runewood logs placed above a totem base. A rite can theoretically require a nearly infinite amount of spirits, however the tallest known rite only requires 5. If you make a mistake while engraving, use an axe to strip of the engraved spirit.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.totem_magic_3": "Once your spirit rite is ready, you need to interact with the totem base in order to activate it. Each engraved spirit will light up one by one, as soon as the very last spirit is lit up your spirit rite will begin. Rites can be either instant or take effect over a prolonged period of time.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.twisted_rock": "When making tainted rock, if we are to replace the sacred spirit with a wicked one twisted rock will instead be made. This is a much stronger rock, perhaps evil wicked spirit is naturally stronger than sacred.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.twisted_rock_architecture": "Much alike the tainted rock, using a crafting table or the stone cutter, you can make many variants of twisted rock.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.tyrving": "The tyrving is a twisted blade specifically made to deal with tough, armored opponents. It is very proficient at crushing through armor, for each point of defense your target has the damage of your tyrving will be increased.",
  "malum.gui.book.page.wicked_spirit": "The enemy of the sacred, this spirit represents the undead. The undead are weird, bizarre beings. Their souls are basically in a state of limbo, stuck in a quickly decaying corpse or an animated pile of bones.",
