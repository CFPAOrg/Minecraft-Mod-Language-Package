You can adjust the item's speed, pitch and yaw via the module's GUI.$(li)Pitch and Yaw are in degrees, relative to a base pitch or yaw."

Otherwise the base yaw is taken from the module's direction.$(li)Example: a speed of 1.0, pitch/yaw of 0°, and a horizontal module direction, will throw an item along the ground for a distance of about 7 blocks."
