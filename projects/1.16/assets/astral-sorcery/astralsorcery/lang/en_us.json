  "astralsorcery.journal.node.SHRINES.name": "Academy Shrines",
  "astralsorcery.journal.SHRINES.1.text": "Areas determined by the Academy to be conducive to field studies have had shrines built in them. These consist of two variants: Larger and more elaborate shrines that contain crystals useful for Starlight manipulation, and smaller shrines that are useful to smaller initiate study groups. Both types include chests with study supplies inside, though the exact contents may change based on the initiates who used that location last. The larger shrines are usually located in areas free of treetops, such as deserts and colder mountain tops.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.SHRINES.2.text": "The larger shrines contain sample Collector Crystals useful for gathering and manipulating Starlight. Each has an attunement to one of the five constellations of the Bright classification, in order to be most beneficial to newer initiates in the beginning of their studies. <NL>While flawless specimens in their own rights, these crystals are crafted from refined, but not pure, bases and so should not be expected to provide the same Starlight energy levels available to practiced crystal crafters who have highly refined their craft. These crystals cannot be enhanced in their performance due to this same issue.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.SHRINES.3.text": "Special wards have been placed to prevent initiates from carrying off or modifying these study tools to maintain the availability for all initiates in a region. <NL>The Academy reminds all initiates that Starlight cannot penetrate opaque, solid materials. While the Academy will install a roofed covering to protect the study areas against inclement weather and hostile creatures should the Academy need to close. Removal of this roofing is necessary for the collection of Starlight if the crystal within is to be in use for learning activities.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.CPAPER.1.text": "Inside the chests of Academy Shrines, there can be found study aids in the form of parchments. These parchments are attuned to the existing Academy archives and will reveal knowledge of an additional constellation to the user when first viewed, as long as their records show sufficient understanding of Starlight Manipulation concepts. Due to this, duplicate records will not be generated for any given initiate. Excess study materials should be left behind for other initiates. These papers can be stored within the Tome",
  "astralsorcery.journal.CPAPER.3.text": "for future reference by opening the Tome while holding Shift. <NL>In the event an initiate would be so irresponsible as to lose their papers, the Academy will not be re-issuing these materials. Instead, the initiate may borrow a copy from another initiate, or recreate them once they have access to a sufficiently advanced crafting altar to properly infuse the constellation knowledge back into parchment. A relatively small cost for such a large lapse of judgment. Thanks to transposition magic, however, papers stored in the initiate's Tome will remain accessible even if the Tome were to be replaced.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.node.WAND.name": "Resonating Wand",
  "astralsorcery.journal.WAND.1.text": "While the floating crystals in the shrines will spill some of their internal Starlight onto nearby crafting tables thanks to the Academy's wards, other crystals will not. As this behavior is also fairly wasteful and magically messy, it will not suffice for more delicate crafting. One of the first tools any initiate should obtain is a wand that will allow them to control the release of Starlight energies from Starlight sensitive devices and crafting implements by right-clicking them.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.WAND.3.text": "Due to its sensitivity to gathered Starlight energies, the wand can be used at night to determine areas of conflicting Starlight resonance. The vibrations of this wand, when exposed to open Starlight at night, reveal areas deep underground where contained Starlight energies are contained by a §3crystalline form§r. <NL>These revealed areas appear as almost smokey areas of Starlight displacement above ground.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.WAND.4.text": "One final use of a Resonating Wand is that attempting to activate a Starlight device that requires a supporting structure built around it will alert the wielder when the supporting structure is incorrect. Due to the disruptions in flowing Starlight, missing or misplaced portions of the structure will be visually highlighted, allowing for rapid troubleshooting in the construction of these structures.",

These crystals have a unique internal structure that makes them particularly receptive to Starlight. Despite the relative fragility of these crystals, they are held within hard veins of rock that are prone to destroying the fragile crystals inside unless mined by a tool sufficiently hard itself, such as diamond. Their resonation with Starlight energies becomes visible while holding a Resonating Wand",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ALTAR1.name": "Luminous Crafting Table",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.1.text": "The purity of Starlight easily realigns the contents of materials into a more ordered state for their intended purpose. By placing a crafting table near an Academy Shrine's Collector Crystal, its wards will direct Starlight to transmute the crafting table into a crafting instrument more suited to an initiate of the stars. Made of the purest marble, this entry-level altar table can cleanly absorb Starlight energy from the sky or a linked Collector Crystal, and redirect the magical energy into the crafting materials laid in it, instead of relying on a constant magically-messy flood of power.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.2.text": "In order to capture Starlight on its own, this table needs an unobstructed view of the sky directly above. It also lacks the required matrix that a Collector Crystal possesses to gather Starlight efficiently, and due to this is unable to compensate for atmospheric diffusion of Starlight energy. Measurements by the Academy indicate sea level is roughly the mid-point in diffusion losses, with bedrock showing nearly full diffusion loss of the energies. Atmospheric diffusion losses disappear at around twice the distance from bedrock as sea level itself.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.4.text": "If the table is above the atmospheric diffusion height, or other factors make raising the table higher are infeasible, relocating the table to another location in the world would be recommended. Starlight energies are not uniformly distributed from the heavens, and there are areas of the world with far more concentrated Starlight energies available than others. Thankfully, a recurrence of Icarian Famine has not repeated, and survey teams have not recorded instances in modern times of locations with almost no exposure to Starlight energies over large areas.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.5.text": "Once the items needed as ingredients for the crafting recipe are laid out within the table, right-clicking the table with a Resonating Wand will release the reservoir, flooding the ingredients with Starlight power. The resulting crafting item will be ejected from the table automatically once the crafting completes. The current reservoir of stored energy is displayed below the table item interface itself. Due to the volatility of Starlight,",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.6.text": "the storage does not function like a battery that charges over time, but instead reflects the current amount of ambient captured Starlight available for crafting. All but the most simple devices, tools, and material manipulations will require more Starlight than this table can safely redirect and provide with its reservoir. <NL>Once an initiate has used it to build the necessary tools to continue their education, they will also have gained sufficient knowledge in the needed Starlight concepts to improve upon this table, making it far more effective.",

Magically pristine and highly reflective of magical energies, this marble can be found in sparse veins underground.

The magical resonance of the marble is fundamentally changed in this way, so that even washing off the dust does not change the new appearance or efficacy of the marble, along with the qualities of the magical energy absorbed and reflected through that surface.
