*The Bindings were offered, simply made of dyed leather, but the magic was known [...]*

;;;;;

The Acolyte's Bindings and the Archmage's Tether serve a unique purpose: to allow someone to start a spell as another caster.

<recipe;trickster:leash>

When the unlinked Bindings are worn and their wearer is crouching, the Tether may be used on them to link the two. 

;;;;;

Once bound, using the Tether with a spell inscribed will execute that spell as the wearer of the Bindings. 
The spell will take one of their spell slots, consume their mana, and be at their position. 
However, it will receive as its first argument the entity which made use of the Tether.


*[...] and he accepted it graciously, his freedom a small price for the teachings of his Archmage.*
