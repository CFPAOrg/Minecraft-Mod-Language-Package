The caster's hat is quite an ingenious accessory.
After equipping it on their head, a caster can press the <keybind;key.trickster.take_hat> 
button to take the hat into their offhand quickly.


When a hat is held in your offhand, you can right-click to open it, and insert up to 27 scrolls.
These scrolls can then be selected by shift-scrolling while holding the hat.

;;;;;

Now, when a running spell tries to access the spell in your other hand via [Notulist's Delusion](^trickster:tricks/basic#3),
it will read the spell from the selected scroll in the held hat instead.


You can also access the spell in any slot of your hat directly using [Cranium Stratagem](^trickster:delusions_ingresses/imports#3),
or read the selected slot using [Cranium Delusion](^trickster:delusions_ingresses/inventory#7).

;;;;;

A few different types of hat are available depending on your likes and preferences!
They all function the exact same though.


The classic Top Hat:

A mysterious Witch Hat:

And even the humble (but very cool) Fez:
