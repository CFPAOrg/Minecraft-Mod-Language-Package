The Scroll and Quill can be used to easily write and store complex and reusable spells.


Right-clicking it opens the [Spell-Scribing](^trickster:editing) interface, letting you directly modify the contained spell.


Scrolls can be stored in a [Top Hat](^trickster:items/top_hat) for easy access and safe-keeping.

;;;;;

The written spell can be read from the scroll by means of [Notulist's Delusion](^trickster:tricks/basic#3).
It is also possible to write to a scroll programmatically using [Notulist's Ploy](^trickster:tricks/basic#4)

Scrolls can be dyed by combining them with any dye in a crafting table:

<|item-tag@trickster:templates|tag-id=trickster:dyed_scroll_and_quill|>

A Scroll and Quill can also be signed by shift-right-clicking it.
This lets you give it a custom name for free, but it cannot be written to anymore by any means.

;;;;;

However, signed scrolls can be charged with one to eight vials of spell ink, 
a special concoction that imbues scrolls with a single-use pool of mana.


Scrolls that have been imbued with mana can have their contained spell cast at no risk to the user, 
however, doing so consumes the scroll. 

;;;;;

Single-use scrolls have an internal buffer of mana with a capacity equivalent to the amount of spell ink used in their making, times 100.

Do Not Consume!
