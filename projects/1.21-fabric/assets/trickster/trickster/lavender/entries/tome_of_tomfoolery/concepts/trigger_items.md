While the [Wand](^trickster:items/wand) is the most common, and most versatile, way of quickly casting spells, it is not the only one available. 
Other items may cast their inscribed spell upon certain criteria being met. These items and their criteria are described here. 

;;;;;

<|page-title@lavender:book_components|title=Warrior's Rage|>On tools and melee weapons, 
the Warrior's Rage executes the inscribed spell when bringing harm to an entity. The targeted entity is received as the first argument.

;;;;;

<|page-title@lavender:book_components|title=Prospector's Glee|>Prior to destroying a block, 
the Prospector's Glee begins the spell inscribed on the held tool. The position of the breaking block is received as the first argument.

;;;;;

<|page-title@lavender:book_components|title=Performer's Grace|>Moments before touching down on a block, 
the Performer's Grace triggers a spell inscribed in footwear. The distance that the wearer fell is passed as the first argument. 
When held back by water, there is no Grace to the Performer.
