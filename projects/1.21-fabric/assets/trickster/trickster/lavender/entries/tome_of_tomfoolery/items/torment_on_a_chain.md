During their studies of spellcasting, many mages will eventually run into the limitations of their innate spell slots,
whether it's their limited number, or their ephemeral nature. 
While [Spell Constructs](^trickster:items/spell_construct) partially alleviate these issues,
they are bulky and immobile, providing rather limited flexibility.

;;;;;

Fortunately, it seems that the [Torment Spell Core](^trickster:items/spawner_spell_core)'s 
innate connection to nearby casters can be of use here.
With the application of a little extra Torment, 
the bulky spellcasting device can be compacted down enough to be comfortably worn around a mage's neck.


While worn, the core will cast and sustain any spell inscribed on it with no effort required from its wearer.
