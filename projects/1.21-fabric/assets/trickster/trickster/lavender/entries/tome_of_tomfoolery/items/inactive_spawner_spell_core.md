Nether Wart shows potential for the lining of a [Spell Core](^trickster:items/spell_core). 
Its transformative properties enable the conversion of energy necessary to power a spell from a spawner's essence.


A Shell may be constructed from the Wart, a Nether Quartz, and Iron to bind it tightly.

However, it is not a functioning Core in itself. 
By interacting with a spawner while holding this Shell, the spawner's essence may be absorbed. 
Only then will it function when placed within a [Modular Spell Construct](^trickster:items/modular_spell_construct).
