Somehow, cracking an Astral Knot has increased its capacity by a truly staggering amount.
Its original capacity of 1048 kG has been multiplied by a factor of sixteen, to roughly 16.8 MG.

;;;;;

However, the Knot's inherent mana regeneration ability has been completely crippled.
It now **drains** mana at a rate proportional to its current supply, making it ill-suited for long-term storage.
