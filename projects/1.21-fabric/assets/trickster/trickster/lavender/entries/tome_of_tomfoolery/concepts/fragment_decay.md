Some types of fragments, such as {#338888}Entities{}, have a rather loose connection to their targets.
While these fragments can generally be handled and used just fine, this imparts some restrictions that other types do not suffer from.

;;;;;

If at any point these so-called ephemeral fragments are inscribed, messaged, or otherwise transferred between spells,
they tend to decay into a unique fragment type referred to as {#444444}##Zalgo##{}.


This process makes them completely useless for their original purpose, 
but these {#444444}##Zalgo##{} fragments do have a few unique properties that make them potentially useful in other ways.

;;;;;

To begin with, any one {#444444}##Zalgo##{} fragment will never be equal to any other fragment, not even itself.


Additionally, feeding a {#444444}##Zalgo##{} fragment into [Decaying Distortion](^trickster:distortions/misc#3)
seems to produce a completely random and unique result every single time.
