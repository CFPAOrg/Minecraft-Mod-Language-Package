Although [Scribing Patterns](^trickster:editing) allow for spells to be edited before they are cast, 
the following patterns allow for a spell to modify other spells *during* the cast.

;;;;;

<|page-title@lavender:book_components|title=Note: Addresses|>Just as elements of a list are accessed by their index, 
parts of a spell are accessed by their address. 
An address is a list of integers that forms a path to a specific circle in a spell.

;;;;;

To find the address of a circle, start at the central circle in the spell. Next, find the sub-circle attached to the central circle that is in the
path to the circle you are finding the address of. Take the index of that circle, which is the number of circles that come before it, counterclockwise. 
Repeat this process, adding each index to the list until you reach the circle you are finding the address of. The list you constructed is the address to
that circle.
