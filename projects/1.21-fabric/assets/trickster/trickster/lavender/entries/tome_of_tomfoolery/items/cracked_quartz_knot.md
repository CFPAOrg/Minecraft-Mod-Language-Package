When cracked, a Quartz Knot retains a lot of its unique qualities,
though they become greatly exaggerated, and are arguably even more interesting.


Quartz Knots already aren't known for their mana-related capabilities, 
but their cracked variant holds **no mana at all**.

;;;;;

On the other hand, its ability to accelerate constructs is enhanced.
When inserted into a construct, its casting speed is increased by 50%.


However, doing so will vastly limit the construct's capabilities, as it will have no access to mana.

;;;;;

Additionally, the timekeeping abilities of the Knot also change.
It still keeps a counter that ticks up about 20 times per second, but it no longer starts at zero from its creation.


Instead, the number it seems to be keeping track of is significantly larger, and now unable to be offset.
It might even be in the same ballpark as the age of the world itself...
