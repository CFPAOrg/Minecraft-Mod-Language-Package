Mana is what fuels ploys. It is the cost of manipulating the world.


As is tradition, amounts of Mana are measured in Gandalfs, or G, named after a certain famous wizard.
One Gandalf being defined as the amount of magical energy required to light a candle.

;;;;;

Any amount of Mana that is lesser than one kiloGandalf, or kG is generally considered negligible.


Draw rate, or any change in Mana, is measured in Merlins, or M.
Merlins are defined as Gandalfs per Tick,
Ticks being the smallest unit of meaningful time, at 1/20th of a second.


For example, a spell drawing 50 M would consume 1 kiloGandalf per second.

Mana can be persistently stored and acquired via Knots.
See [this entry](^trickster:items/knots) for more information on those.
