<|trick@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:battery_creation|>

Creates a [Knot](^trickster:items/knots) using the crystal in the given slot and a Glass Block. Uses amethyst if no first slot is provided.

;;;;;

<|page-title@lavender:book_components|title=Note: Mana Transfers|>Mana can only ever be moved between the caster's 
reserves and external slots, never between two arbitrary external slots. 
When pushing to or pulling from multiple slots at once, load is equally split between all of them.


When pulling or pushing mana over a distance lesser than 16 blocks, transfers are lossless.

;;;;;

Over greater distances though, 
a loss is incurred proportional to the amount of mana transferred multiplied by distance.


This loss follows a roughly exponential scale, reaching around 50% at or near 100 blocks of distance.

;;;;;
