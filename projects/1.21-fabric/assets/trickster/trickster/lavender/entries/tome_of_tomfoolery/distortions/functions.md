Just as values can be created, passed around, and used by spells, so can parts of the spell itself.


When nesting one circle as a glyph inside another, 
but not immediately providing any subcircles to the upper circle, 
the upper circle will return the inner circle as a fragment.

;;;;;

This fragment can then be used in a number of ways, including being written to an item using [Notulist's Ploy](^trickster:tricks/basic#4), 
and being cast later or even multiple times within the same spell.


It is also very possible to pass a spell fragment inside of itself, and execute it again there, 
using recursion to create what is essentially a loop.

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:execute,title=Grand Stratagem|>

spell, any... -> any

---

A powerful trick indeed, it executes the passed in spell fragment, 
providing it with all other passed in fragments as arguments.

;;;;;

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:execute_same_scope,title=Quiet Distortion|>

spell -> any

---

Executes the given spell with the current spell's arguments.

;;;;;

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:fork,title=Utensil Stratagem|>

spell, any... -> number

---

Dispatches the given spell to a free spell slot. The used spell slot is returned, or a negative if it failed.

;;;;;

<|page-title@lavender:book_components|title=Note: Collections|>Collections are fragments which contain other fragments and may be accessed using a specific key. 
Lists are collections where the key is a whole number between zero and the size of the list, exclusive. 
Maps are also collections, though their keys may be any value and aren't automatically determined by order of insertion.

;;;;;

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:fold,title=Folding Distortion|>

spell, collection, any -> any

---

For each entry in the collection, execute the given spell, with the given fragment as the first result.

;;;;;

Each iteration receives four arguments:

---

any, any, any, collection

---

Where the first argument is the result of the last iteration, the second is the current value, the third is its key, 
and the fourth is the given collection.

;;;;;

The result of each execution is passed as the first argument to the next, where the last's result is the return of this trick.

;;;;;

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:try_catch,title=Cautious Stratagem|>

spell, spell, any... -> any

---

Attempts to execute the first spell. If it blunders, the second spell is run and the blunder is silenced. Excess values are arguments to both.

;;;;;

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:atomic,title=Stratagem of Singularity|>

spell, any... -> any

---

Executes the given spell in a single tick, blundering if it's not possible due to spell size or illegal operations.

;;;;;

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:supplier,title=Supply Distortion|>

any -> spell

---

Creates a new spell fragment which returns the previously provided fragment when executed.

;;;;;

<|glyph@trickster:templates|trick-id=trickster:closure,title=Closure Stratagem|>

spell, {any: any} -> spell

---

Replaces the keys of the map that are in the given spell with the value they map to.

;;;;;

<|page-title@lavender:book_components|title=Note: Arguments|>Fragments can be passed into executed spell fragments as arguments.
