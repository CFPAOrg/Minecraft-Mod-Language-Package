Scroll Shelves are a nice way to store and visually display your collection of spells in the world.
These blocks function similarly to Chiseled Bookshelves, 
you can right-click a scroll into any of the empty slots on its front side,
and take it out with another click.

Scrolls on a shelf will display in the color they're dyed as, if applicable,
and when targeted with your crosshair, will show their name for easy browsing.


Shelves can interact with hoppers.
