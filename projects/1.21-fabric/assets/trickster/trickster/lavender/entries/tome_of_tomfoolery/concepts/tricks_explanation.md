All tricks fit in the following categories:

- Delusion: no-input value-generating tricks
- Distortion: fixed-input pure tricks
- Ingress: tricks that gather information based on input
- Ploy: input-only and/or mana-consuming tricks

;;;;;

- Revision: scribing patterns
- Stratagem: any trick that operates on a variable amount of inputs

These categories are roughly followed, but in many cases, 
tricks will be sorted based more on intention than rigid definition.
