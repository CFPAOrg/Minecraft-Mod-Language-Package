All tricks fit in the following categories:

- Delusion: tricks that gather information purely from context
- Ingress: tricks that gather information based on input
- Distortion: fixed-input pure tricks
- Stratagem: variable-input pure tricks

;;;;;

- Ploy: world-manipulating and/or mana-consuming tricks
- Deviation: tricks which modify the state of the spell itself
- Revision: scribing patterns

These categories are roughly followed, but in many cases, 
tricks will be sorted based more on intention than rigid definition.
