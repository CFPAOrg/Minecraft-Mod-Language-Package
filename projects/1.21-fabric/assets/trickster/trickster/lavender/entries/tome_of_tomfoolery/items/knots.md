Knots are gemstones encased in glass orbs that hold a certain
amount of [Mana](^trickster:concepts/mana) based on the rarity of the gem they're made from.


Some gems have unique properties when made into a Knot, such as Amethyst,
which, unlike other gems, already contains Mana when converted,
but cannot be recharged naturally.

;;;;;

Most gems or crystals can be made into Knots using
[Ploy of the Moon Watcher](^trickster:ploys/mana#2).


This ploy optionally takes two arguments, 
one [slot](^trickster:delusions_ingresses/inventory#4) containing a gem, another holding a Glass Block.
If the latter isn't provided, the first available Glass Block will be used.
If the former isn't provided, an Amethyst Shard will be used in the same manner. 
As such, it is not possible to create non-amethyst Knots without providing a slot reference.

Other gems and crystals may be able to be turned into Knots as well, 
but this must be determined on a case-by-case basis.
