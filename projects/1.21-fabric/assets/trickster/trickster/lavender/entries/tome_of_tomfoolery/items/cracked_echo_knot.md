Found in the remnants of an ancient civilization, these [Knots](^trickster:items/knots) are broken, and yet still usable. 
They recharge naturally at only twice the rate of an Emerald Knot, but have a capacity twice that of a Diamond Knot.


There is something else that is strange about this Knot.

;;;;;

When a slot which contains a Cracked Echo Knot is given as the second argument to a [Ploy of Receipt](^trickster:ploys/message#3), 
it behaves rather queerly. Doing the same with a [Dispatch Ploy](^trickster:ploys/message#2) appears to alter *something*.


It is uncertain how exactly these two ploys interact with the Cracked Echo Knot. 
However, any attempt to make use of these oddities beyond the context of a player caster yields no results.
