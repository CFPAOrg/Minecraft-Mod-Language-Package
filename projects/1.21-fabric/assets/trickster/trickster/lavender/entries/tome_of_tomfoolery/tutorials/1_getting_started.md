To begin writing spells, you'll need to gather a few magical tools to help you.


At a bare minimum, you'll need a [Mirror of Evaluation](^trickster:items/mirror_of_evaluation) 
and a [Scroll and Quill](^trickster:items/scroll_and_quill).
These items form the basis of a spellcaster's toolkit.

;;;;;

<|item-spotlight@lavender:book_components|item=trickster:scroll_and_quill|>The Scroll and Quill is where you actually write your spells.
These enchanted pieces of paper can hold any single spell circle, 
and allow you to easily modify it, just by using the item.

;;;;;

<|item-spotlight@lavender:book_components|item=trickster:mirror_of_evaluation|>The Mirror, which you'll also need, serves a variety of purposes.


For one, it can be used to directly cast the spells you write in scrolls, 
something that scrolls cannot do on their own.


More often though, the mirror will be used for prototyping.

;;;;;

It functions very much like a scroll, with a similar interface, 
except that any glyphs written in a mirror will be cast the moment its possible to.
The center of their circle will then be filled with the result of their execution, if any.


This behaviour is also often used to generate constant values, 
which can then be embedded into other spells, written in scrolls.

Aside from these essential items, a few other things may be worth gathering:

- A [Wand](^trickster:items/wand) can be inscribed with any spell to directly cast it, as explained later.
- A [Top Hat](^trickster:items/top_hat) holds multiple scrolls in one item, and can serve as a form of memory for more advanced spells.
