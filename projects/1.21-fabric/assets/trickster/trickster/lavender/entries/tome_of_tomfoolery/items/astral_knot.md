Of a Nether Star, the Astral [Knot](^trickster:items/knots) is made. 
With a capacity multiple orders of magnitude greater than a Diamond Knot, 
the Astral Knot has a strange quirk: similarly to the Amethyst Knot, 
the moonlight does not replenish its stores. Instead, it replenishes itself.

;;;;;

The Astral Knot generates mana passively with regard to its current stores. 
The fuller it is, the faster it fills. However, it does not generate mana when completely empty.
