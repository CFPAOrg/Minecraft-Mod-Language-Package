The Amethyst Whorl is little more than a cheap trinket, but it serves its purpose: it may contain up to 256kG, and will fill at a constant rate of 1kM when worn around the neck.


Just like a [Knot](^trickster:items/knots), the stored mana is available to the wearer's spells.

;;;;;

An Amethyst Whorl may be carved from a single shard, and worn around the neck by use of a simple copper and string attachment.
