*"Look guys! We built the Torment Nexus from the hit sci-fi novel 'Do Not Build The Torment Nexus'!"*


A variant of the [Spell Core](^trickster:items/spell_core) powered by the essence of a spawner. 
It executes its inscribed spell at one and a half times the rate of player spells. 
However, if no player is within 16 blocks, it will pause completely.
