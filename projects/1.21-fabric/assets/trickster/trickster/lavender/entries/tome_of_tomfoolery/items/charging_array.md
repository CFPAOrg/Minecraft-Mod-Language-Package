A Charging Array is a simple stone plate with nine slots for holding [Knots](^trickster:items/knots). 
They can be placed in any orientation. 
Knots stored in the Array can be charged by the moon as if they were thrown on the ground.

;;;;;

While they may look similar to a [Spell Construct](^trickster:items/spell_construct), 
Charging Arrays are not capable of casting spells. 
However, external spells may interact with the stored Knots just like they would any other inventory.
