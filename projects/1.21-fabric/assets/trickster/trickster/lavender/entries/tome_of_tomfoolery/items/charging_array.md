A Charging Array is a simple stone plate with nine slots for holding [Knots](^trickster:items/knots). 
They can be placed in any orientation. 
Knots stored in the Array can be charged by the moon as if they were thrown on the ground.

While they may look similar to a [Spell Construct](^trickster:items/spell_construct), 
Charging Arrays are not capable of casting spells. 
However, external spells may interact with the stored Knots just like they would any other inventory.
