Spell Cores may be inserted into a [Modular Spell Construct](^trickster:items/modular_spell_construct), 
where they will run the spell inscribed onto them at 75% the speed of a player's.

;;;;;

To construct a Spell Core, one must have a shard of amethyst as a *channel*, a pearl of the End as a *heart*, a thread of gold as a *mind*, and a wrapping of leather as a *guard*.
