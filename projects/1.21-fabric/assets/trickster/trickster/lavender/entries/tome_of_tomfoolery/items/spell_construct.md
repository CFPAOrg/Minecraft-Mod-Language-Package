A Spell Construct is a relatively simple device that, 
when inscribed with a spell and placed into the world, will persistently cast said spell.


Constructs are most useful for [long-running](^trickster:concepts/multi_tick) 
spells that respond to happenings in the world, or trigger periodically.

If a source of mana is required, any [Knot](^trickster:items/knots) 
may be inserted into the center of the Construct with a right-click.
They may also be shift-right-clicked to reset the currently running spell, 
ignoring any previous blunders.
