It seems that Amethyst had a little more potential than imagined! 
By cracking an Amethyst Knot, this potential is unlocked, instantly recharging the Knot back to twice its original capacity.
This means its mana output can be effectively tripled before it becomes obsolete.

It's unclear why this happens. Amethyst may hold more mysteries than initially expected.
