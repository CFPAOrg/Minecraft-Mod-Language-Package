&title(Toppings)
Honey can be poured on them (either via [faucet](^supplementaries:faucet) or by <keybind;key.use> with a [bottle](^minecraft:honey_bottle))

They can also accept other toppings such as chocolate and syrup, available for compatibility with other mods that add such items.


Pancakes with honey, chocolate or syrup will give a short speed effect when eaten.

&title(Jukebox)
You can also insert a pancake in a [jukebox](^minecraft:jukebox) for some sick tunes!
