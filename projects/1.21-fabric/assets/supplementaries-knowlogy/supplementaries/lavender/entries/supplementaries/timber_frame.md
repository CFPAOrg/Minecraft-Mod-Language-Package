&title(Framing)
Each of them can visually hold any solid block inside. This allows to make every block into a framed one. To do so simply <keybind;key.use> on it with said block.


An option to frame an already placed block when <keybind;key.use>ing on it with this item is available in the configs.

;;;;;

&title(Remove Frame)
Using an [axe](^minecraft:tag/axes) on a framed block will break the frame but not the block contained inside.
