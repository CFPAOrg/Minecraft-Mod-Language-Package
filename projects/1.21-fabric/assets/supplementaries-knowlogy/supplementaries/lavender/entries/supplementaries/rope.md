&spotlight(supplementaries:rope)
**Rope Arrows** can be placed against a ceiling, on a fence or wall or next to an already placed rope.


Just like scaffolding they can only go that far out horizontally from their closest support until they are no longer supported.

&title(Hitboxes)
Vertical ropes have no hitbox and can be climbed.


Horizontal ropes do have a hitbox and can be walked on, albeit at a slower paste. Your screen will also wobble as you try to balance on them.

;;;;;

&title(Breaking)
Can be broken by a projectile. Doing so or breaking them will also break connected ropes which are being supported.


Shearing a rope will make remove its bottom connection.

;;;;;

&title(Placing)
Placing a rope against an existing vertical one will result in the rope getting extended downwards, pushing all blocks that are attached to the bottom most rope.


The opposite is also true and can be achieved by shift clicking a rope with an empty hand. This will pull up the last attached block. Useful for wells.

;;;;;

&title(Placing)
Ropes can be placed and will dynamically wrap themselves against many fence like blocks such as walls, beams and posts. This includes many many mods that also add horizontal facing ones like Quark's posts.

;;;;;

&title(Usage)
Falling down ropes will not slow you down but still prevent fall damange. A cool sound will also play.

Can burn really fast similar to gunpowder.

Can spawn in mineshafts in a rare new elevator piece.

Can support [Buntings](^supplementaries:bunting).
