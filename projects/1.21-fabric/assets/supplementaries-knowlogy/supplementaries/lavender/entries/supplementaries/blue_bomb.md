**Blue Bombs** are a more powerful version of [bombs](^supplementaries:bomb). 


They can be found by exploring, usually in chests.

&title(Usage)
A blue bomb explosion will deal significant area damage to entities, will set them on fire and will afflict them with a weakness debuff.
When exploding they can ignite nearby creepers.


Blue Bombs do not explode on impact, instead they will flash once they hit something, giving players a split second to react, then they will detonate.
