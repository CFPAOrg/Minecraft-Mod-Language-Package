&spotlight(supplementaries:key)
**Keys** are tools used to lock [Safes](^supplementaries:safe), [Netherite Doors](^supplementaries:netherite_door), [Netherite Trapdoors](^supplementaries:netherite_trapdoor) and [Lock Blocks](^supplementaries:lock_block).


To open a locked block you won't need to have the correct key in hand, it just needs to be in your inventory or Curio slot.
