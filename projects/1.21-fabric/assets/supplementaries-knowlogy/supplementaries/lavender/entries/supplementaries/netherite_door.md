&spotlight(supplementaries:netherite_door)
A **netherite door** is a type of [door](^minecraft:tag/doors) made of netherite that just like [safes](^supplementaries:safe) they can be locked with [keys](^supplementaries:key). Once this is done only a key owner can interact with them.


By default they are accessible to anyone until first locked.
