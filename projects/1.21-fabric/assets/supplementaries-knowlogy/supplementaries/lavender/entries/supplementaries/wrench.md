&spotlight(supplementaries:wrench)
**Wrenches** are a handy tool which can be used to rotate any kind of rotateable block. They even work on blocks you might not expect them to like [signs](^minecraft:tag/signs), [way signs](^supplementaries:tag/way_signs), double skulls, double chests and beds.

&title(Usage)
<keybind;key.sneak> + <keybind;key.use> to reverse the rotation direction. The rotation axis will be the one of the face you click.


They can also rotate some entities like item frames and armor stand (this interaction requires <keybind;key.attack>ing tho).

&title(Attacking)
Additionally wrenches double as a fast melee weapon which deals same damage as a wooden sword but is much faster and can even be [enchanted](^minecraft:enchanting) with knockback.
