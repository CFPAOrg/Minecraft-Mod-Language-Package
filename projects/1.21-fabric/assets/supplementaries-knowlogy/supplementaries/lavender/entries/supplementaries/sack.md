Sacks are heavy and when carrying more than 2 the player will have the overencumbered effect applied.

&title(Falling)
Is a gravity block and will deal damage when it falls on an entity. Damage depends on sack content.

&title(Usage)
Its slots and properties are configurable in the configs.


Can be interacted with similar to a [bundle](^minecraft:bundle).


With quark installed it also has a fancy tooltip.
