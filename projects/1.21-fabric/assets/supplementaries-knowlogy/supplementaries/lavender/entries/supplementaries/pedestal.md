&spotlight(supplementaries:pedestal)
**Pedestals** can have one item placed on top of them.

&title(Usage)
Certain items like swords, tools and tridents and globes will have special visual properties when displayed on a pedestal.


If an end crystal is placed on a pedestal the block will give off an [enchanting](^minecraft:enchanting) power equal to 3 bookshelves. This means that with 5 of such blocks you'll be able to max out an enchanting table.

;;;;;

&title(Redstone)
Once an item is taken or removed from a pedestal the block will give out a observer detectable update. Useful for traps.


This can be prevented if one swaps the item with a [sack](^supplementaries:sack).
