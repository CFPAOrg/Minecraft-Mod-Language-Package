**Rope Arrows** are an arrow variant that once shot it will try to deploy a rope coil wherever it lands.

&title(Usage)
Can be crafted to hold up to 24 ropes (can be configured in the configs).
Shot rope arrows will retain all the ropes they didn't place so remember to pick them back.


Useful when adventuring caves.
