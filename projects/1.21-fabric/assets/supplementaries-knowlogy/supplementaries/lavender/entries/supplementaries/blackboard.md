&spotlight(supplementaries:blackboard)
**Blackboards** Can be written on to create interesting pattern in black and white. Basically a bare bones MS Paint in Minecraft.

&title(Crafting)
<recipe;supplementaries:blackboard>

;;;;;

&title(Drawing)
Can also be directly edited without the GUI by holding a dye item. This also supports other mods like chalk or similar items like quatz or coal. Doing so won't consume the item.


Will keep its drawing when broken.


The current drawing can be previewed using the item tool tip.

;;;;;

&title(Usage)
Blackboards can be duplicated just like banners.


Can be cleared by using a wet sponge or [soap](^supplementaries:soap).


Can be [waxed](^minecraft:honeycomb) to prevent interactions.


Can accept [glow ink](^minecraft:glow_ink_sac)


Colored blackboards can be enabled in the configs.
