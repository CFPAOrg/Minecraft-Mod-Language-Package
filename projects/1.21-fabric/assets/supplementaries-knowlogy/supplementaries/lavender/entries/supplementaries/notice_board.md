&title(Displaying Book)
When it's displaying a written book it will only show one page at the time.


The text resolution that is getting displayed depends on the amount of text in a page. Add whitespaces to make it render smaller.

;;;;;

&title(Redstone)
Once given a redstone pulse it will turn the currently displayed page onto the next one.

;;;;;

&title(Waxing)
Can be [waxed](^minecraft:honeycomb) to prevent interactions.
