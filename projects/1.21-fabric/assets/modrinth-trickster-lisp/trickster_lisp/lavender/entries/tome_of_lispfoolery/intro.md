To start transpiling spells, you'll need to craft a [Transpiler](^trickster_lisp:items/transpiler).


If you want to store your code somewhere, you can use [Paper and Pencil](^trickster_lisp:items/paper_and_pencil).


You can start learning how to write your spells in LISP, by creating some spells with Trickster
and then [loading](^trickster_lisp:transpiling/interface) spells to see what they look like in LISP!

Refer to [language reference](^trickster_lisp:transpiling/lang_ref) to learn how this mod represents Trickster fragments.


You can also write some [macros](^trickster_lisp:transpiling/macros) to simplify your code.
