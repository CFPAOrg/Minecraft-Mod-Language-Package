Derrick
OSHA Nightmare
<&derrick0>
The Derrick creates wellheads by drilling reinforced pipes into porous strata containing <link;immersivepetroleum:reservoir;§o§nfluid reservoirs§r> beneath the bedrock.<np>
The structure is built as shown and formed by using the Engineer's Hammer on the single light engineering block.

Fluids are input through the blue fluid port, and fluid is output from the singular orange fluid output port. Drilling pipes must be input by hand.

Applying a redstone signal to the control panel will halt the drilling process, and can be inverted by use of the Engineer's Screwdriver.<np>
The derrick's drilling process happens in two stages, and cannot happen below the water line as water will flood the nascent drill hole and erode the walls.

The first phase is the reinforced drilling phase, when the derrick drills above the bedrock and must reinforce the placed fluid pipes with <link;immersiveengineering:mixer;§o§nliquid concrete§r> to stabilize them, placing well pipes. If broken, these pipes must be re-drilled.<np>
Once the derrick has hit bedrock, the second drill phase begins and concrete reinforcement is swapped for cooling water. The derrick begins drilling through the bedrock to one or more target locations that can be set via its interface, consuming water and fluid pipes to do so.

When the well is completed the wellhead is opened and the drilling equipment is forced out of the well by the fluid pressure from below.

Positive pressure from the well forces fluid to the surface and into the derrick's tank and out to external storage such as the <link;immersivepetroleum:oiltank;§o§nOil Tank§r>. If the derrick's tank is full and has no ability to output, the pressure relief valve will blow and oil will gush from the top of the derrick and become waste.

Once the positive pressure in the reservoir has dropped to zero, the derrick is no longer needed, and fluid extraction can be moved to a <link;immersivepetroleum:pumpjack;§o§nPumpjack§r>.
