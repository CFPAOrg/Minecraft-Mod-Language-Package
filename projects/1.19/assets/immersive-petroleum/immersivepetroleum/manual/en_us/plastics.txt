<link;immersiveengineering:plastic;§n§oPhenolic resin§r> is a chemical marvel for the modern age, but it was missing a petroleum derived process for its production.

Using newly developed thermal cracking systems, this is no longer: phenolic resin can be produced from <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§onaphtha§r;naphtha> feedstock using a combination of high temperature techniques to crack it into its constituent alkenes.
<&plastics1>
The <link;immersivepetroleum:hydrotreater;§n§oHigh-Pressure Refinery Unit§r> is used to crack naphtha, converting 20mB naphtha and 5mB of water to 20mB of cracked naphtha.

Cracked Naphtha can then be <link;immersivepetroleum:distillationtower;§n§odistilled§r> into benzene, propylene, and ethylene; the three alkenes produce portions of the chemical process for <link;immersiveengineering:plastic;§n§ophenolic resin§r>.
<&plastics2>
Benzene is a liquid alkene, and can be combined in the <link;immersiveengineering:refinery;§n§oRefinery§r> with propylene for phenol, more commonly known as <link;cokeoven;creosote oil;outputs>.

Ethylene is a gaseous alkene that oxidizable to acetaldehyde. This process is done using §2Copper Plate§r as a catalyst.

These two chemical feedstocks are used to produce the polymer resin of <link;immersiveengineering:plastic;§n§oduroplast§r;duroplast_sheet>.
