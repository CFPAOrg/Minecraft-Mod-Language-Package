Coker
Very Sticky Stuff
<&cokerunit0>The Coker is a massive machine that cracks and carbonizes residual <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§obitumen§r;bitumen> from distillation into <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§opetroleum coke§r;petroleum_coke> and <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§osulfurized §n§odiesel§r;diesel>.

Energy is input through the two high-amperage connectors on the front of the machine, and bitumen and water to the two labeled input ports on the front of the machine. Sulfurized diesel is output from the orange port on the front, and petroleum coke from the two hoppers below the coking drums.

Supplying a redstone signal to the control panel will halt the coking process, which can be inverted with the use of the Engineer's Screwdriver.

Due to the heating-cooling cycle of the coking process, the Coker is an energy-intensive machine that requires medium or high voltage infrastructure.

To construct the machine, build it as shown and use the Engineer's Hammer on the concrete block in the center on the side with the redstone engineering block.<np>
The coking process is thus:
Bitumen is loaded into the coking drums. Once loading has finished, the drums are brought up to temperature and the bitumen is converted into petroleum coke and sulfurized diesel.

When the conversion is complete, the drums are drained of sulfurized diesel, then dumped and flushed with water to cool down for bitumen to be loaded again.<np>
The coking drums do not need to be full for the coking process to begin, and more bitumen can be input during the first phase of the coking cycle. Once the output and flushing phases have begun, more bitumen cannot be input until the cycle completes.

The coking drums operate independently: once the currently loading coking drum is full of bitumen, bitumen will load into the other drum unless the drum is already operating.
