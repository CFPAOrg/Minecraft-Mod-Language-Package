Lubrication
Slip and Slide
Lubricated bearings and gearboxes are present in almost every machine, but heavy-duty gearboxes and bearings benefit from their lubricant being regularly flushed and replaced.

Machines with high mechanical loads — such as the <link;immersivepetroleum:pumpjack;§n§oPumpjack§r>, <link;excavator;§n§oExcavator§r>, and <link;crusher;§n§oCrusher§r> — can be actively lubricated to increase their speed by 25%.

Iron Golems can be lubricated, temporarily increasing their speed and strength.<np>

<link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oPetroleum lubricant§r;lubricant> is the most effective lubricant, but <link;squeezer;§n§oplant oil§r> can also be used to lubricate machines, at the cost of consuming much more lubricant.

Both Iron Golems and machines will drip spent lubricant while in use, a handy sign of if the machine is lubricated.
<&lubricant1>The Lubricant Can can be used to manually apply a lubricant to machines. Once the can is full, simply use on a valid block to lubricate it.

A <link;chemthrower;§o§nChemical §o§nThrower§r> can also be used to apply a lubricant to blocks, albeit less efficiently. Simply spray lubricant onto a machine to apply.

The Automatic Lubricator is the solution to the tedium of manual application, lubricating as long as it has fluid.
The point where it must be attached is highlighted while holding a lubricator. When placed correctly, pipes will form around the machine.
