Portable Generator
Gassed Up
<&portablegenerator0>
The Portable Generator is an easily-movable, light fuel alternative to the heavy, immobile <link;immersiveengineering:diesel_generator;§n§oDiesel Generator§r>.

The generator connects to LV and MV power grids directly, and can be picked up with it contents by crouching.<np>
The Portable Generator produces up to <config;i;portablegenerator_flux> IF/t while burning fuels such as <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§ogasoline§r;gasoline>, <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§onaphtha§r;naphtha>, or <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§obenzene§r;naphtha_derivates>, and has an energy buffer of 100,000IF.

The Portable Generator can accept fuel from buckets, jerrycans, and from a pipe through the input port on top of the generator.

Higher quality fuels will last longer, and a redstone signal will immediately halt the generator with no lost fuel.
