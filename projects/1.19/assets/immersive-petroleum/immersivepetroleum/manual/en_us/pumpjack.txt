Pumpjack
Pump, Pump It Up
<&pumpjack0>
The Pumpjack is a machine which pumps liquids from wellheads created by the <link;immersivepetroleum:derrick;§o§nDerrick§r>.
The structure is formed by using the Engineer's Hammer on the heavy engineering block on the second layer.<np>
Pumpjacks are the workhorse machine of petroleum extraction, producing a slow but steady amount of liquid from their wells by lifting it through a one-way valve to overcome the lack of well pressure. Wells that still have pressure will overcome the pumpjack's valve and will gush liquid.

To operate, the headpipe connection must be placed directly atop the wellhead so the valve apparatus may be lowered into the wellhead.<np>
The Pumpjack uses <config;i;pumpjack_consumption> Flux/t to pump liquid at a rate of <config;i;pumpjack_speed> mB/t. Liquids are output through the side ports with orange dots.

The average oil reservoir will take <config;i;pumpjack_days> days to deplete with one pumpjack. Some reservoirs, once the reservoir's hydrostatic pressure is below equilibrium, will replenish fluid that can be extracted by the Pumpjack.

Applying a redstone signal to the control panel will halt the pumpjack motor, this behavior can be inverted by use of the Engineer's Screwdriver.
