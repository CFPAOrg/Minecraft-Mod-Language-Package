Multiblock Projector
Invaluable instructions
<&projector0>When it comes to building large multiblock structures, referring to your Engineer's Manual time and time again has grown tedious. By crafting a primitive projector device, you believe you can project schematics of these structures into the world to use as a template.<np>
Its GUI can be overwhelming at first, but it is very simple.

The left side shows a list of every existing multiblock.
Selecting one will show the finished multiblock on the right side, and also the currently selected multiblock name will show up over the GUI itself.

The center houses buttons to change the rotation and mirroring, the current rotation is indicated by §0§lN§r, §0§lS§r, §0§lE§r or §0§lW§r above the rotation buttons.<np>
Once you are happy with your decision, click §2§lConfirm§r, which will lock in your selection and close the GUI.

Clicking §4§lCancel§r will just close the GUI without doing anything.

Sneaking and right clicking in the air switches between Projection or Selection Mode.<np>
Holding a Projector will display the structure. Pressing §0§l<keybind;key.immersivepetroleum.projector.flip>§r will flip the structure, and sneaking while scrolling will rotate it. Right clicking will lock the image in place, where it will show as long as the Projector is in your hotbar.

Sneaking and right clicking with a projector that has a locked image will unlock the image.

In Creative mode, sneaking while locking the image will build the multiblock automatically.
