High-Pressure Refinery Unit
What's A Palladium Catalyst?
<&hydrotreater0>
The High-Pressure Refinery Unit heats and combines fluids within its main reaction drum. It is integral to secondary process chains in modern petroleum refining, including cracking and desulfurization.<np>
Fluctuating power demands from the place the High-Pressure Refinery Unit between LV and MV, with more intensive recipes unable to use LV wiring. Power is input through the port on top of the heating unit.

Fluids are input through the port on the front of the machine, water into the top port beside the control panel. Items are output from the side port beneath the water input, and the reaction product from the port atop the reaction drum.

It is built as shown and formed by using the Engineer's Hammer on the heavy engineering block in the of the front face.

Applying a redstone signal to the control panel will halt the machine, this behavior can be inverted with the Screwdriver.

If pneumatically-processed plastic is available, the High-Pressure Refinery Unit can process both <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§oethylene§r;naphtha_derivates> and <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§opropylene§r;naphtha_derivates> into molten plastic at a 10x or 20x yield respectively.
