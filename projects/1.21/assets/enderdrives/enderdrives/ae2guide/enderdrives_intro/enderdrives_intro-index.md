# EnderDrives!

EnderDrives focuses on a different way to store items.  These drives link together based on the frequency set for each drive. All drives with the same frequency and privacy share the same contents, regardless of who crafted them. Whether in your AE2 system, another dimension, or on another playerâ€™s system, the contents are globally synchronized.
