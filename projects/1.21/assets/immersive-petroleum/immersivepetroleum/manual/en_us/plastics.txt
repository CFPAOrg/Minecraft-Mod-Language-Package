<link;industrial_fluids;Phenolic Resin;resin_acetaldehyde> is a chemical marvel for the modern age, but it was missing a petroleum derived process for its production.

Using newly developed thermal cracking systems, this is no longer the case: phenolic resin can be produced from <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;Naphtha;naphtha> feedstock using a high temperature processing to crack it into <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;§n§opetroleum gas;petroleum_gas>.
<&plastics1>
The <link;immersivepetroleum:hydrotreater;§n§oHigh-Pressure Refinery Unit> is used to crack naphtha, converting 1500mB naphtha and 500mB of water to 2000mB of petroleum gas.

Petroleum Gas cannot be used to produce <link;industrial_fluids;phenolic resin;resin_acetaldehyde> directly as resin is a heavy polymer. The raw mixture must be processed into precursors for the resin in a <link;refinery;Refinery>.

Combining <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;Benzol;benzol> and <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;Petroleum Gas;petroleum_gas> in the <link;refinery;Refinery> with §2Redstone Dust§r as the Catalyst results in the production of <link;industrial_fluids;Creosote Oil;creosote_oil>

Petroleum Gas can be oxidized to acetaldehyde using §2Constantan Plate§r as a catalyst.

These two chemical feedstocks are used to produce the polymer resin of <link;resin_and_duroplast;Duroplast;duroplast_sheet>.
