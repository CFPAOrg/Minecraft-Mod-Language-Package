Petroleum Products
At Least It's Not GT5u
<&crude>
Crude oil is a sticky, black substance that seeps from <link;immersivepetroleum:reservoir;reservoirs> in the world. It is the base resource that all other petroleum-based resources take their feedstock from, and is essential to a petrochemical engineer's journey.

Crude oil can be separated in the <link;immersivepetroleum:distillationtower;Distillation Tower> once it is extracted from reservoirs.
<&lubricant>
Lubricant is the heaviest fraction immediately distillable from <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;crude oil;crude>, and is best used to increase the working speed of machines via their lubrication. It can be processed into <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;paraffin wax;paraffin>.

It can be burned in the flare stack or cracked into <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;sulfurized diesel;diesel> if such activities are not useful.
<&diesel>
Diesel and sulfurized diesel are the heavyweight fuels of the petrochemical engineer, being able to be used in the <link;diesel_generator;Diesel Generator> for bulk power production.

Sulfurized diesel can be used for an easy source of sulfur, and is the second-heaviest fraction distillable from <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;crude oil;crude>.
<&kerosene>
Kerosene is a medium fuel usable in the <link;diesel_generator;Diesel Generator> for bulk power production. It can be separated into its light and heavy fractions to upgrade <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;Naphtha;naphtha> into <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;gasoline;gasoline>.

Being a lighter fraction than <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;diesel;diesel>, kerosene does not accumulate sulfur and does not need to be desulfurized.
<&naphtha>
Naphtha is a volatile light fuel usable in <link;immersivepetroleum:portable_generator;Portable Generators> or <link;immersivepetroleum:speedboat;Motorboat>, and the lightest fraction in <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;crude oil;crude>.

Its volatility can be controlled via mixing it with gasoline additives to form <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;gasoline;gasoline>.

Naphtha is chemical feedstock for producing plastics, and is used to produce <link;industrial_fluids;phenolic resin;resin_acetaldehyde> from its <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;cracking products;petroleum_gas>.
<&bitumen>
Bitumen is a dark, sticky solid that can be used as artificial binder for concrete, making <link;immersivepetroleum:asphalt;asphalt concrete>, or pyrolized to make <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;petroleum coke;petroleum_coke>.

Bitumen is created from the distillation of <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;crude oil;crude> at a slow rate.
<&petroleum_gas>
Petroleum Gas is not immediately distillable from crude oil, this lighter feedstock must be cracked from <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;Naphtha;naphtha>.

Petroleum gas cannot be used in generators due to its gaseous nature. Instead, it can be used as a chemical feedstock for <link;industrial_fluids;phenolic resin;resin_acetaldehyde>.
<&benzol>
§2Benzol§r is an aromatic intermediate feedstock used for refined products such as <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;Gasoline;gasoline> or <link;immersivepetroleum:plastics;Duroplast;plastics2>

§2Benzol§r can be created from the secondary distillation of <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;Kerosene;kerosene>, as its lighter fraction.
<&gasoline>
Gasoline is a high-quality light fuel suitable for the <link;immersivepetroleum:portable_generator;Portable Generator> or <link;immersivepetroleum:speedboat;Motorboat>, and can also be used in <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;napalm;napalm>.

It has reduced volatility and a higher efficiency in the <link;immersivepetroleum:portable_generator;Portable Generator>.

Gasoline is mixed in the <link;refinery;Refinery> via the addition of <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;Benzol;benzol> to <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;Naphtha;naphtha>.
<&napalm>
Napalm is an extremely flammable substance that can be created in the <link;mixer;Mixer> using <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;gasoline;gasoline> and three measures of aluminium grit. It has little use other than wanton destruction; when napalm is lit, fire will spread almost immediately over its surface, allowing for rapid deforestation. In addition, it can serve as a very effective fuel for the <link;chemical_thrower;Chemical Thrower>.
<&paraffin>
Paraffin wax is a waxy solid that can be used as an artificial beeswax substitute, making candles or waxing copper to stop it from oxidizing.

Paraffin wax is created from the dewaxing at high pressure of <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;lubricant;lubricant> at a slow rate.
<&petroleum_coke>
Petroleum coke is a high-purity allotrope of carbon, equivalent to coal coke. It can be used to make steel, or compressed into <link;coke_and_graphite;HOP graphite;graphite>.

Petroleum coke is created from the coking at high temperature of <link;immersivepetroleum:fluids;bitumen;bitumen>.
