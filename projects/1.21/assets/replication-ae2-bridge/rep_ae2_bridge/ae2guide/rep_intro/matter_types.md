# Matter Types

The Replication system uses different types of matter to represent various materials. Each matter type has specific properties and is used to replicate different items.

## Basic Matter Types

  <ItemIcon id="rep_ae2_bridge:nether" />
  <ItemIcon id="rep_ae2_bridge:organic" />
  <ItemIcon id="rep_ae2_bridge:ender" />
  <ItemIcon id="rep_ae2_bridge:precious" />
  <ItemIcon id="rep_ae2_bridge:quantum" />

## Matter Conversion

The RepAE2Bridge allows you to convert items to and from these matter types automatically through the AE2 interface. Each item has a specific matter composition that determines how much of each matter type is needed for replication.
