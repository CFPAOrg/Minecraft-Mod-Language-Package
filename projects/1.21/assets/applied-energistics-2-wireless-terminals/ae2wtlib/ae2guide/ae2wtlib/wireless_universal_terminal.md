# Wireless Universal Terminal

<ItemImage id="ae2wtlib:wireless_universal_terminal" scale="3" />

The <ItemLink id="ae2wtlib:wireless_universal_terminal" /> is a combination of multiple [Wireless Terminals](wireless_terminals.md) into one item.

All [AE2WTLib Wireless Terminals](wireless_terminals.md) can be combined into one terminal.

AE2's <ItemLink id="ae2:wireless_terminal" /> can ***NOT*** be combined into a <ItemLink id="ae2wtlib:wireless_universal_terminal" />.


## The UI

The <ItemLink id="ae2wtlib:wireless_universal_terminal" /> adds a button to the terminal UI,
which can be left-clicked (and right-clicked) to cycle to the next (or last) [Wireless Terminal](wireless_terminals.md).


## Upgrades

The <ItemLink id="ae2wtlib:wireless_universal_terminal" /> accepts the same upgrades as the installed [Wireless Terminals](wireless_terminals.md).
Each installed terminal adds 2 upgrade slots.

## Energy storage

Adding terminals combines their energy storage,
so a <ItemLink id="ae2wtlib:wireless_universal_terminal" /> with two terminals has twice the energy storage of a [Wireless Terminal](wireless_terminals.md).
