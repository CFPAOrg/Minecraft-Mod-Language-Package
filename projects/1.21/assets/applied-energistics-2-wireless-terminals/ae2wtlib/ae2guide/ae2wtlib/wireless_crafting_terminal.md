# Wireless Crafting Terminal

<ItemImage id="ae2:wireless_crafting_terminal" scale="3" />

The <ItemLink id="ae2:wireless_crafting_terminal" /> is a [wireless](wireless_terminals.md) version of the <ItemLink id="ae2:crafting_terminal" />.
AE2WTLib adds automatic [restocking](restock.md) from the ME Network, and allows Pick Block to draw items from the ME Network.   
With a <ItemLink id="ae2wtlib:magnet_card" /> it also acts as a magnet.

It can be combined with other [Wireless Terminals](wireless_terminals.md) into an <ItemLink id="ae2wtlib:wireless_universal_terminal" />

AE2WTLib enhances Minecrafts `Pick Block` functionality, it will draw items from the network if they can't be found in your inventory.
(It will also try to store items if your current slot happens to be full)
