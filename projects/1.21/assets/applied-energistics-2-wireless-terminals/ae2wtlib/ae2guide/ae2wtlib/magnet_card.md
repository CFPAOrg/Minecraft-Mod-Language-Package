# Magnet Card

<ItemImage id="ae2wtlib:magnet_card" scale="3" />

The <ItemLink id="ae2wtlib:magnet_card" /> is an [Upgrade Card](ae2:items-blocks-machines/upgrade_cards.md) for the <ItemLink id="ae2:wireless_crafting_terminal" />.
It adds a magnet to the <ItemLink id="ae2:wireless_crafting_terminal" /> which can be toggled or filtered in the GUI.
There is also a keybinding to turn it on or off.

The <ItemLink id="ae2wtlib:magnet_card" /> does two things:

1. Pick up items in a larger range (configurable, default is 16)
2. Place picked up items in the ME System instead of your inventory

Both can be toggled separately, and filtered separately (pickup filter and insert filter).
Either filter can be set to blacklist or whitelist mode.
