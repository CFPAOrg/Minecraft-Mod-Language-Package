# Quantum Bridge Card

<ItemImage id="ae2wtlib:quantum_bridge_card" scale="3" />

The Quantum Bridge Card is an [Upgrade Card](ae2:items-blocks-machines/upgrade_cards.md) for [AE2wtlib Wireless Terminals](wireless_terminals.md).
It allows linking your [Wireless Terminals](wireless_terminals.md) to a [Quantum Bridge](ae2:items-blocks-machines/quantum_bridge.md).

Put a quantum Bridge Card and a <ItemLink id="ae2:quantum_entangled_singularity" /> in your wireless terminal,
and put the other singularity in a [Quantum Bridge](ae2:items-blocks-machines/quantum_bridge.md) connected to your network.

Your Wireless Terminal is now Quantum Linked, can access your network from anywhere, even across dimensions (assuming the chunks containing the network are loaded, e.g. with a <ItemLink id="ae2:spatial_anchor" />),
and will automatically recharge with energy from your network.
(make sure your network has enough [energy storage](ae2:items-blocks-machines/energy_cells.md))
