In summary, the flesh of zombies can curdle to Rotting Essence; the bones of skeletons can crystallize to Grim Talc; the wings of phantoms can spin to Astral Weave; the essence of the breeze can persist as the Wind Nucleus; and the magic of endermen can coalesce into Warp Flux.",

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ether.2": "A peculiarity of Ether's flame is that it resonates with colors. As if it was leather to be dyed, I can tint its appearance. It is an emitter of light, so dyeing it darker colors will lower the intensity rather than change the color of the flame itself.",

When created, this form of Ether locks in its original color, leaving a new, $isecond/$ color open to dyeing. The light will shift from the original color into the new color towards the peak of the flames.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ether.iridescent.2": "Getting the right coloring for this can be tricky, though. As stated, once Ether is made Iridescent, its original color can no longer be changed. This is hardly an issue, but should be kept in mind when tinting your flames.",

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.primary_arcana.sacred.1": "Sacred arcana is essential to any magic that enhances life. It can be defined as holy, the energy of particularly vibrant life, or even the simplicity of youth. It is pure and untainted, making it a useful component.",

To avoid the metal touching me directly, and so jostling and rubbing against my very soul, I used thin plates of Twisted Rock beneath the metal of the armor.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstained_armor.2": "As it exists in both the arcane and physical realms, Soulstained Steel exhibits fascinating defensive properties. It can intercept attacks from both, creating an effect I call Soul Ward. It takes time to restore if the effect is disrupted, but it acts as additional armor which nearly absorbs magic damage completely, and dampens physical damage.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstained_armor.3": "This effect seems similar in nature to others I have studied, such as engraving runes into armor or invoking a black sun upon oneself. Though unlike those, it doesn't $iappear/$ to have a cost. Where is the energy for Soul Ward coming from?",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstained_scythe.1": "The scythe I created to harvest spirits was useful, but ultimately has outlived that usefulness. I have grown fond of the utility it provides, though, and so instead of discarding it I sought to improve it. With Soulstained Steel, I was able to create a more effective weapon and maintain the scythe's advantages.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstone.1": "Sometimes, it appears that matter can be charged with the energies of a soul, despite not having a soul of its own.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulstone.2": "This serves as the basis for spirit arcana - the ensouling of the soulless. Soulstone is an ore that exists more in the arcane than the physical, and, refined, presents many uses for my magic. It strongly radiates magic.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood.1": "After further study, I have discovered that the Soulwood produced by the Unchained Rite has actually become an entirely different species from the Runewood it is made from. It grows differently, it acts differently...",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood.2": "It appears the spiritual scars that created it go deeper than just its color and magic. The most obvious differences with the tree itself are shape and leaf color. Soulwood is more spindly than Runewood, and its leaves are a sickly purple-red hue instead of a rich orange-yellow. It can still be used for many of the same things, though.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood.blight.1": "Another obvious difference is in its effect on the surroundings - namely, the fact that it echoes the Undirected Rite with the energies of its growth, transmuting the world around it into blight. I ought to create a safely contained area if I wish to grow these trees.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood.bonemeal.1": "Much like blight, the sapling accepts both spirit arcana and common fertilizers such as bonemeal. The end result is roughly the same across both options.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwood.cursed_sap.1": "The sticky lifeblood of the tree also seems to well up much more often in a tree than in Runewood. The sap's effects are corrupted as well; rather than restoring my vigor, Cursed Sap enhances it, increasing my attack strength and providing damage resistance.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwoven_pouch.1": "Magical reagents and other loot can clutter the inventory. Why not solve a problem of magic with magic? This pouch acts like a bundle, but also snaps up loot as it comes. Materials with arcane resonance are additionally rotated slightly out of reality, making them take up less space.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwoven_silk.1": "Soulwoven Silk is a light, yet sturdy material imbued with soulstuff. Like a body, it naturally insulates against arcane energies. While other materials do the same, cloth is far easier to work with in designing than stone.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.soulwoven_silk.soulwoven_banner.1": "Soulstuff can glow, as a shattered soul proves. Why not activate that glow within the cloth? I have made banners to test the effect, and used differing reagents and spirits to give a variety of patterns. When imbued, they will glow dimly, or fiercely if given an additional spirit.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_crystals.1": "The soul is a notoriously fickle thing. Even confirming its existence is difficult, requiring the highest thaumaturgies to get a reading. That is what sets spirit arcana apart from other magic. We don't need grand assemblies and esoteric artifice to see a soul. Simply destroying it is proof enough.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_crystals.2": "A material I have named Soulstone is the means by which we do so. It appears mundane until refined, but once it is rid of impurities, it seems... out of phase with the world. By creating a blade using it as a core, I should be able to strike not only the physical form, but also the soul, shattering it to energy before it can disperse.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_crystals.3": "These energies, as previously noted, have different 'frequencies' of sorts. A being burning with light would have a soul that reflects that radiance, and a being prone to adaptation would have a soul as malleable as itself. Occasionally, the energy has no flavor to it at all, leaving only the raw impulse of creation behind. That type of crystal bears further study.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_focusing.1": "Using the opposing polarities of Twisted and Tainted Rock, I have created a device that draws in and focuses arcane energy. If given a compatible substrate, I can use this process to create things.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_focusing.2": "The basic substrate here is the Alchemical Impetus, an artifact similar to those I've seen in the past. By focusing arcana into it, I can cause bits of the calx to transmute into something new, though this damages the Impetus in the process.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion.1": "By using Runewood's natural magic as a base, I have designed the altar that will serve as the basis for my magecraft - the Spirit Altar. It is the other piece of the equation, the use for the arcana. By infusing them into items, and using the energies to effect other fusions, I can begin to explore this.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion.2": "To use the altar, I must lay the item I wish to infuse on top of it, along with an appropriate set of arcana. If I wish to fuse other items in the process, I must place them on some form of Runewood item holder. They must be within four blocks of the altar to work.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion.3": "Once all the arcana are present, the power within the crystals will begin to flow into the central item. If other items are fused in, they are pulled in during this process. When all of that is done, the product of the infusion will appear. It $iis/$ rather slow, though...",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion.alchemical_calx.1": "Lastly, I have created an experimental substrate I named Alchemical Calx. It's initially strong and tallow-like, but when met with a lesser amount of force it turns extremely malleable. It's bound to prove an useful ingredient.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion.hex_ash.1": "My first product with this process is a powder I call Hex Ash, after its color. It is a simple and useful grit, with the niter and sulfur mostly transmuted by the raw arcana, leaving a mixture of reagent and carbon.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_infusion.living_flesh.1": "Next, for the sake of understanding how spirit arcana interacts with living substance, I have created... $isomething/$ which is now known as Living Flesh. It is a disgusting meaty chunk completely unfit for human consumption. Who knows if I'll end up finding a proper use for it.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_jar.1": "A simple application of hallowed gold is the Spirit Jar. As spirits in their raw form don't have mass, by trapping them under Hallowed Gold you can store far more than you could physically. The capacity of these jars is near-infinite, though each only stores one type of spirit.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.hallowed_gold.1": "Gold is often used as a thaumaturgical base, its natural conductivity of magic making it quite useful. Spirit arcana are no exception. In fact, using Sacred arcana, we can enhance those conductive properties.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.hallowed_gold.2": "Hallowed Gold, as a metal, acts much like its mundane counterpart. The inherent innocence of the arcana infused into the alloy makes other arcana glide through it smoothly, creating the perfect conductor for my purposes. It also makes for some quite fashionable item peripherals.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.reexamination.1": "The inherent structures of the arcana simply don't exist in spirit metals, and yet they interact with the arcane all the same. There might be something analogous, but if so, I hardly have instruments precise enough to measure it. Why is this is different from the raw stones I have investigated, with even Soulstained Steel differing in structure vastly from Soulstone?",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.reexamination.2": "This might explain why Cthonic Gold has arcana fused into its structure, unlike the spirit metals - they might be different phenomena, one a metal 'tuned' to the arcana, another physically alloyed with it. I wonder if I can tune other metals similarly...",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.soul_stained_steel.1": "Iron is mundane, in a word. By attuning the metal with Soulstone, I can create a steel that is $isimultaneously/$ in and out of phase with the world.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_metals.soul_stained_steel.2": "Anything made from Soulstained Steel is capable of striking the soul, without the need for specifics of engineering like with my crude scythe. Wearing the metal in its base form as armor is dangerous, as it will touch your own soul as well, so I must engineer a countermeasure.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_minerals.reexamination.1": "I now know the arcana have physical properties with meaning. I can use these properties to create a staff, and likely for many more things. But Soulstone and Brilliance... as far as I can tell, for every other base material relevant to the arcana save Runewood I work with, there are either spirit crystals fused within or patterned in the structure.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_minerals.reexamination.2": "The fact that Null Slate is physically identical to Soulstone implies a greater principle. I posit that Soulstone and Brilliance have similar fundamental resonances to the arcana, structures of inherent power at a precision far beyond what I can measure. This implies interaction with the arcane is simply... a quirk of an object's topology? I don't know how I would replicate it myself, but if I can...",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_stones.reexamination.1": "It appears that the crystal structures of at least Wicked and Sacred crystals can be tessellated infinitely, as that is exactly what my deconstruction and analysis of samples of Twisted and Tainted Rocks has found them to be. Is it possible that other spirit stones - or rather, tessellations - might exist? Very likely.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_stones.reexamination.2": "But what would their properties be? Sacred and Wicked create stone which accept or reject magic... so might Aerial and Earthen create stone that either moves or locks magic in place? Redundant for both, with Hallowed Gold... Infernal might be used to accelerate while Aqueous mutates, though, which might be useful.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_stones.reexamination.3": "I don't think I have the proper context to identify what Arcane, Eldritch, and Umbral might create. I lack the full understanding of what they represent, as destructive testing isn't an option for Umbral as of yet. But, with the proximity of bedrock to the Void... might bedrock's indestructibility be a sign of the Umbral stone?",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_stones.tainted_rock.1": "Stone is reluctant to change, but nothing can endure the power of an unchained soul forever. By using raw arcana to force that change, I have created stones with useful magical properties. With Sacred arcana as the catalyst, it forms Tainted Rock, a stone that dissipates magic nearby.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_stones.twisted_rock.1": "With Wicked arcana's nature as the opposite of Sacred, it follows that the stone produced with it would act opposite. Twisted Rock has most of the same properties as Tainted Rock, but pushes magic away from it instead of dissipating it. Both can be fashioned into item holders, as Runewood can.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_trinkets.1": "Many disciplines of magic, and even more mundane practices, allow the creation of useful trinkets. These are also referred to as baubles or curios by some. The metals I have alloyed have properties useful in their own rights, and can be used as the basis for even grander designs.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirit_trinkets.2": "In their most basic form, Hallowed Gold trinkets protect the user as if they were wearing weak armor, and Soulstained Steel trinkets increase the toughness of the armor being worn.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.spirited_glass.1": "I have designed a simple but aesthetically pleasing glass which is tinted by the arcana, framed in iron. The particles of the glass are 'aligned' by the power placed within - which means Raw and Eldritch, having no direction, are somewhat chaotic. They do still look interesting, though.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.suspicious_device.1": "Being opposed, you $ican/$ use Arcane and Eldritch to create an opposition augment. However, this just causes violent entropy as Arcane flows eagerly into the end state of Eldritch, and the result is... a corruptive explosion generating Blight. This entry serves as a warning, not a recommendation.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.sympathy_drive.1": "Wicked and Sacred are opposed forces, so why not harness them together? When a Sympathy Drive-affected Crucible's Impetus takes damage, the Wicked charge will remember. When it is healed by the Mending Diffuser, the Sacred charge will 'forgive' the damage, repairing further and improving stats generally for three cycles.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.the_device": "even works while bended",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic.1": "Up until now, when performing spirit arcana, I have limited my research to personal enhancement and material production. Now, I affect the world.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic.2": "To begin with Totem Magic, I may engrave spirit arcana into Runewood Logs, forming a rune representing the magic. If unwanted, engraved spirits can be stripped off with an axe, but I have uses in mind. With a Runewood Totem Base, and then a specific set of runes in a totem pole placed above my totem base, I can perform a Spirit Rite.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic.3": "While each rite does offer a unique function, they follow patterns and categorize easily. For what I term \"aura rites\", they are simple, effect-providing rites that affect anything living within eight blocks of the base. For other rituals which alter beings, most affect anything within half the range of an aura rite.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic.4": "For those which alter blocks, most affect the five-by-five area on the level beneath the base, towards where the runes are facing.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totem_magic.5": "One caveat is that no rite's totem may function within the range of another, identical ritual. If you try, the first one will simply fizzle out, the energies coursing through it disrupted.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totemic_runes.1": "Trinkets are not the only things that can be inscribed into Runes. I have managed to create runic tablets of Runewood and Soulwood, on which I can inscribe the patterns of what I refer to as \"aura rites\". The ritual's effect is more potent, but the rune doesn't need to stay in one place.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.totemic_runes.2": "These tablets are inscribed much the same as any other rune, though only the basic rites of the four elements are functional. These entries go into further detail on each.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.tyrving.1": "My first scythes damaged the body and soul in sequence to shatter the soul. While I have moved beyond needing to do that, the Tyrving is a sword built to weaponize the effect.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.tyrving.2": "When Striking a Soul, the Paracausal Flame channeled through Twisted Rock creates a distortion, which inflicts magic damage proportional to the complexity and potency of a soul. The distortion also 'snaps back', after a moment, causing further damage after the initial strike as the soul violently reasserts itself.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.tyrving.3": "A Unique limitation however is that the sword cannot sweep and by extension cannot accept Sweeping Edge as an enchantment",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.tyrving.4": "The weapon has a strange affinity with sharp volcanic glasses, allowing me to repair it with Obsidian in a Spirit Crucible instead of any more expensive material.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.unchained_transmutation.basalt.1": "In Basalt, the rite appears to mimic natural stone's pulverization, but through Nether materials instead. Basalt returns to magma, which crumbles apart and cools into fleshy Netherrack, and rots into Soul Sand. The souls react poorly with the rite, and Blight is the result.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.unchained_transmutation.deepslate.1": "One of a trio of seemingly color-based sequences, Deepslate will - a bit more logically - become Tuff. That Tuff will then degrade into Andesite, which will then rejoin other types of stone in their sequence.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.unchained_transmutation.dirt.1": "In dirt, the rite encourages growth without any source. The dirt first grows wooden roots through its structure, which then somehow become grass. The mechanism is conceptual, and the next stage makes that even more clear - moss covers the dirt, consuming the entire volume of it. After that point, the growth has no direction to go, and it becomes randomized, creating Blight.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.unchained_transmutation.intro.1": "The Unchained Rite's echoes can scar more than simply Runewood. The patterns seem somewhat random, but then, blight is a substance of randomness. Trial and error has identified three categories; transmutation trees, of sorts.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.unchained_transmutation.intro.2": "The effect of applying these scars depends on what material we start with. The pulsing of the Rite will shift any given block forward in the tree, with it degrading into blight given enough time.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.unchained_transmutation.mud.1": "In mud, the rite infuses the material with the concept of water. Mud becomes clay, as it does naturally, but then the clay crystallizes into mineral prismarine, which finally gives in to the water, becoming ice. It cannot become more water than frozen water already is, and so becomes Blight.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.unchained_transmutation.packed_mud.1": "One of a trio of seemingly color-based sequences, Packed Mud seems to fulfill the conditions to become Dripstone, oddly enough.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.unchained_transmutation.snow.1": "One of a trio of seemingly color-based sequences, Snow bizarrely will become Calcite. That Calcite will then degrade into Diorite, which will then rejoin other types of stone in their sequence.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.unchained_transmutation.stone.1": "In raw stone, the rite powders the stone, bit by bit. The process is exponential - Raw stone becomes cobblestone, which becomes gravel, which becomes sand. Afterwards, the particles fail to divide into a finer substance, and the backlash creates Blight.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.undoing_geas_bindings.1": "Ah, a pact that binds forever is a heavy thing. Geasa are potent, yes, and can achieve powerful effects, but their downsides are constant companions.
