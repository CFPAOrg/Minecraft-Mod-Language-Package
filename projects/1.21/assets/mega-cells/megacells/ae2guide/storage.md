## MEGA [Storage Cells](ae2:items-blocks-machines/storage_cells.md)

</Row>

As mentioned earlier, the <ItemLink id="megacells:accumulation_processor" /> serves as the first step towards putting
together any MEGA infrastructure, and this includes its own higher tiers of storage cells to start with. With this
processor, a <ItemLink id="ae2:cell_component_256k" /> can be taken *even further beyond*, from **1M** (equivalent to
"1024k") onwards to the highest M tier of **256M** â€” over *one thousand* times higher in capacity than 256k.

<RecipeFor id="cell_component_16m" />
<RecipeFor id="cell_component_64m" />
<RecipeFor id="cell_component_256m" />

Of course, more capable storage will require a more capable housing to boot, which is where some more Sky Steel comes in
to craft an item cell housing for your new M-tier components.

</Row>

For fluids and everything beyond, there are also dedicated housings. As it turns out, Sky Stone is powerful enough that
it can alloy with some other metals to also form the appropriate cells, such as copper to make fluid cell housings out
of **Sky Bronze**. Even outside of this guide, whatever you can think of may be supported by MEGA and a dedicated cell
with its own housing type.

## MEGA [Portable Cells](ae2:items-blocks-machines/storage_cells.md#portable-item-storage)

MEGA also provides portable versions of all its cells just as AE2 itself does, though the increased capacity of these
cells will demand a fair bit more energy. As such, note that these are crafted with a
<ItemLink id="ae2:dense_energy_cell" /> as opposed to a regular <ItemLink id="ae2:energy_cell" />.

While these portable cells also support the full range of [upgrades](ae2:items-blocks-machines/upgrade_cards.md) that
regular ME portable cells do, their increased battery and overall hunger for power means that the regular
<ItemLink id="ae2:energy_card" /> is not *quite* strong enough to support them. For this purpose, only the
<ItemLink id="megacells:greater_energy_card" /> will do.
