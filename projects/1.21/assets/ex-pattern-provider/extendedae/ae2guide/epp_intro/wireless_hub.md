# ME Wireless Hub

<Row gap="20">

</Row>

ME Wireless Hub works exactly like <ItemLink id="extendedae:wireless_connect" />, but it can connect up to 8 hubs/connectors
at the same time.

## Connection Configuration

There are 8 ports in ME Wireless Hub. It'll find the available port automatically when you link it with <ItemLink id="extendedae:wireless_tool" />.

However, when all of its ports are occupied, you need to disconnect manually by clicking the 'X' button to set up new connections.
