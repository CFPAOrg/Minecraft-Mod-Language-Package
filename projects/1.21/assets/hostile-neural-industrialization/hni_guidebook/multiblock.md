# Multiblocks

Your production can be upgraded even further using the multiblock versions of the previous machines, the [Large Simulation Chamber](./multiblock/large_sim_chamber.md) and 
[Large Loot Fabricator](./multiblock/large_loot_fabricator.md) respectively.

Make sure you have the following before proceeding:
- 
- A self-sufficient **Stainless Steel** production line;
- Lots of **Prediction Matrixes** to craft **Prediction Machine Casings**. Don't worry, you can automate them using an Assembler;
- Access to **Advanced Motors**.
