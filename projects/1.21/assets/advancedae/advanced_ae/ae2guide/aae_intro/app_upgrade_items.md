# Advanced Pattern Provider Upgrades

AdvancedAE provider items that enable you to upgrade pattern providers without having to move all your patterns and
upgrades.

## Advanced Pattern Provider Upgrade

<ItemImage id="advanced_ae:adv_pattern_provider_upgrade" scale="3"></ItemImage>

These upgrades can be used on regular AE Pattern Providers and ExtendedAE's Extended Pattern Providers. Using it on
these machines will upgrade them to the advanced version keeping the same amount of slots they had previously. This
means you won't lose the materials used to upgrade regular providers to extended providers in the process.

## Advanced Pattern Provider Capacity Upgrade

<ItemImage id="advanced_ae:adv_pattern_provider_capacity_upgrade" scale="3"></ItemImage>

Capacity upgrades are used to upgrade regular Pattern Providers directly to an Advanced Pattern Provider with 36 pattern
slots.
