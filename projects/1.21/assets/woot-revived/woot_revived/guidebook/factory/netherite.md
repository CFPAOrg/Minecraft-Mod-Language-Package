# Netherite

The fifth and last tier of your factory.

## Design

Note that the Fake Spawner that are small in the preview are optional

The <ItemImage id="layout" scale="0.5"/> [Layout](../machines-blocks/layout.md#netherite) configured on the fifth tier can help you to build it

<GameScene zoom="2.5" interactive={true}>
    <ImportStructure src="../assets/factory/netherite.snbt" />
    <IsometricCamera yaw="195" pitch="6" />
</GameScene>
