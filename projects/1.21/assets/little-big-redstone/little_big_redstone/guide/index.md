# Little Big Redstone

<MarginFloatingImage src="assets/logo.png" left="0" right="10" />

Little Big Redstone adds a [Microchip](microchips.md) block that can have [logic](logic/introduction.md) placed in it
so more complex logic systems can be compacted into one block.

This includes the standard logic gates such as [NOT](logic/not_gate.md), [AND](logic/and_gate.md),
[OR](logic/or_gate.md), and so on and so forth. There are also some logic components that can be used for delaying,
shortening, or lengthening a signal such as with the [Sequencer](logic/sequencer.md) and
[Pulse Throttler](logic/pulse_throttler.md).

There are also tools that make working in microchips easier, such as the [Logic Array](logic_arrays.md) which holds
items used in microchips, and the [Floppy Disk](floppy_disks.md) which allows you to copy and paste circuits.

All items come in all dye colors to allow for personalization, expression, and organization!
