# Controller

Core of Quantum Reactors

It produce Heat and Energy based on Fuel Cells when actived with a redstone signal

It has an AOE to define all valid blocks

Right clicking on it will show Heat and FE rate

## MODES:

- waiting
  -> no redstone signal provided

- overheated
  -> heated

- no fuel
  -> recipe output is full / recipe input is empty / no valid fuel cells

- production
  -> produce and continue recipes
