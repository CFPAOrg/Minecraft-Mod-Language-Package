How to Use

<&usage1>You're going to need the hammer and a material of your choice.
See <link;immersiveposts:posts;this;start> for a detailed list of things able to be used.<np>
<&usage2>Then with your chosen material in hand right-click the base with it and it should look like what's being shown in the image above.
Note: It always has to be of the same type! A wooden post for example only accepts §oTreated Wood Fences§r nothing else!<np>
<&usage3>From here you can also right-click the post itself which makes it easier to see how high you've already made it.

Isn't that neat?<np>
<&usage4>Now, to get the 1-Wide arm you simply right-click with your hammer in hand at the desired side and height. To remove it right-click the side of the post the arm is on. (Or break it with an axe)
§nNote: It won't appear if there is a block in the way.§r<np>
<&usage5>Right-clicking the arm itself will turn it into a 2-Wide arm and vise-versa.

Like with the 1-Wide, if there isn't enough space it will not change.<np>
<&usage6>The one 1-Wide Arm flips up-side-down if it detects any block below it, §oeven§r if there is already one above it.

For §ostability§r reasons, the 2-Wide Arm however can §lnot§r flip up-side-down.<np>
<&usage7>§nPost Arm§r
Placing non-solid blocks on the sides (Like connectors/relays) makes these cute little arms appear, making sure whatever you attached doesn't look like it's floating in the air.<np>
<&usage8>§nHorizontal Truss§r
Line up two posts with at least 1 block (up to <config;i;maxTrussLength>) of empty space in between.
Sneak + Right-click with the hammer on inner side of them. Do the same if you want to remove an already existing truss.
