It has been acting rather oddly ever since we set up in this tower, to note. Mayhaps our experiments are influencing it? Regardless, merely a night prior to writing this log, another such flash occurred - closer, this time, and I could make out something left behind in the impact.

When I came close to it, all I could see were smashed golden fragments damaged beyond sensibility - useless! I have waited about eight days, and now another one has struck - this time, I was prepared for it. Notably, these things seem to occur a lot more frequently when the moon is full. I am making the preparations now to carry what this strike left behind into the tower; I have already setup a suitable testing apparatus....",

There exist a wide variety of machines, for the production and processing of many resources. Why do we need all of this? Further, the Essence everything is driven by seems strange - the resonance of its usage is in the form of strange melodies that feel oddly familiar, yet I cannot place them. It is like hearing a symphony orchestrated by the world itself.",
  "computer.burrow.small_01.diary_03": "Soon I will visit the factory again. They will have me write answers to questions about the machines, about Essence, and about our great research, in Makutuin. Writing in Makutuin is... difficult; the glyphs are strange and complicated. I fear I will do poorly. I may be given a lowly position like monitoring the Leeches...
