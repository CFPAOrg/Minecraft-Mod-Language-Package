On insert/stock mode it specifies how much to fill up the specified energy acceptor. $(br2)For example: If the block can hold 1,000,000 FE, and you specify 50%, it will only fill up to 500,000FE."

If you are using a mod like Draconic Evolution or Mekanism, their storage cells can store greater than this amount by 'hacking' how Forge Energy works. As a result, this % indicator will not work on storage cells greater than 2.14 billion FE. Sorry! :)"
