Study cannot be made without my physical aids. As such I have to make due with some primitive and crude methods. A mortar and pestle although simple, proves to me a valuable tool and a cheap system to process basic ingredients.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poison_basics.1": "Basics for a mortar and pestle can be made in a crafting table with the following pattern. Its use will be significant for the first product of in my research.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poison_basics.2": "In my initial studies I sought a way to process the volatile substance, poison in order to control its behaviors. I realized I needed something foundational, malleable. In my hours of toiling and understanding of alchemical reactions, I made a base for future recipes that allowed me to use poison as a mixture of various plants and ingredients.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poison_basics.3": "Although rather weak, it was to be used for my experimental research. An ingredient that can be refined later but tested now. A proof of concept. The recipe is easy to produce as it will eventually be used consistently in my future recipes.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poison_basics.4": "All it requires is at least one naturally poisonous plant and one poison ingredient not of herbaceous origin. Then finally some bone meal to put it all together.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poison_basics.5": "Unfortunately, as I no longer have the academy resources, a lot of the materials for poison paste are not easy to obtain. Without an assistant, I will have to manually retrieve them. Although I am not accustom to foraging, it is what I must do. Fortunately I have already done extensive research on poisonous flora. I can already document my knowledge on these specimens.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.0": "Ocelot Mint is a rather dangerous poisonous mint. Discovered after an unfortunate ailment possessed a temple excavation crew. Equally unfortunate was learning the excavation crew were actually my junior students. After obtaining their samples, the jungle became my new obsession for the next few weeks.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.1": "Nightshade is as beautiful as my first love. And just like her, it packs much more under its bushy exterior. Like a mirage, its vibrate petals hide black berries that are dangerous when consumed. Like a gorgeous nymph in the dark forest. Which conveniently is where these deadly day lilies are found.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.2": "Water Hemlock has a cloudy appearance but you would be mistaken to think it had any similarities to real clouds. These deadly plants exists in marshy and frankly smelly swamps. They are easy to spot but don't make the trek any more enjoyable. Now that I ponder on it, the smell probably came from the deceased wildlife surrounding its base.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.3": "Based on its name, you can discern where it naturally grows. Coldsnap exists in the most frigid taigas. Its vibrant blue is an appealing visual gift, if you wish to quickly befall anyone who receives it. Looking through snowy forests will help you locate these poisonous flowers.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.4": "How did I come to obtain this specimen??? Its rather concerning how any plant life exists in the Nether but Bloodroot, as the name hints, exists in Crimson Forests. I came across this through a trader. Now that I think back, I don't think I was trading with a person.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.5": "Many of the flora can be converted into seeds just by crafting them alone. But in order to plant them, the soil must be as potent as they are. Luckily, my poison paste can convert normal farmland into a much more lethal variant. Just use the poison paste on farmland and voila! I can make a garden just as beautiful as it is deadly.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.6": "Many parts of a mob, including ourselves, react differently when toxins are introduced in their bodies. This makes unique ingredients when certain mobs are afflicted. As such, we should extract them. When a mob dies while being afflicted with poison, they can drop special ingredients. However, a sword is too crude to extract them. As such, they must die by a scalpel in order to carefully extract these valuable ingredients.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.7": "These vicious fangs seems to have convenient cracks and crevasses for feeding in violent venoms. Wolves can develop such dangerous fangs when covered in poison. We can then extract these new fangs when killing wolves with a scalpel. ",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.8": "A strange reaction is formed with spit when poison is introduced into llamas. Some of their saliva take on this green-ish hue. Its still quite delicate so using a scalpel is recommended. Although its still rather gross to hold.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.9": "Squid ink sacs make for a convenient container. Poison sits just inside with the ink. It then melds together as it gets to know each other. Eventually it almost doubles the poison the squid has! Miraculous, and very valuable when gently extracted with a scalpel.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.10": "I thought the Bogged would have a natural affinity to poisons. So with some careful procedures, and a sharp scalpel, I manage to turn those old bones into some brittle but potent ingredients!",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.11": "Slimes enjoy absorbing everything they can get their slimy bodies on. For my next trick, I gave them poison. The outcome was, as I expected, a ball of gelatinous poison. This is both the most delightful and most painful jelly I could ever try.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.12": "Although a little maddening, I've heard of an ancient technique of consuming a blend of these deadly flora to boost ones immune system. They speak of power from these poisonous herbs but I'm not sure how. These plants are rather painful to even touch let alone eat out of the blue. However, their techniques peaked my interest. Why would anyone consume these dangerous plants?",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.13": "After reviewing my old studies, I managed to obtain some recipe for making specialty blends for consumption. Maybe I'll try some a little each day. Although not a leaf more. This is a rather dangerous game.",
  "journal.toxony.page.poisonous_flora.14": "In the event I am overcome of excessive toxins in my body, I should have a golden apple or regeneration potion ready. They provide a remedy should I go overboard and consume too many volatile poisons. I hope this will not be needed, otherwise the pain already is unbearable.",
  "journal.toxony.page.oil_basics.0": "I always envied the creation of lotions and balms. The desire of extravagance can be both irritating and intoxicating. These desires are wasted on cosmetics. My desire however, brings excitement. Many traveling sellswords value good oils. Weapons are expensive, yet improvements are cheap. With untamable mobs that roam the dimensions, applying specialty oils can make the fighting easier.",
  "journal.toxony.page.oil_basics.1": "To create oils, we first need to create a container to hold it. Using clay and some poison paste, I can mold a small pot which can then be fired in a furnace, creating the basic oil pot container for oils.",
  "journal.toxony.page.oil_basics.2": "The basis of my research can now be used on my weapons. Using poison paste, and honeycomb, mixed in a mortar, then collected into an Oil Pot. When striking someone with this oil applied, poison will consume the victim until they are in an inch of their life.",
  "journal.toxony.page.oil_basics.3": "After an incident involving a minor encounter with Water Hemlock, I've learned it has rather coma-inducing effect. And after I bashed my head under my table. Naturally I wanted to turn it into an oil. When striking someone with this oil applied, victims will naturally feel slower and weaker.",
  "journal.toxony.page.oil_basics.4": "Sometimes you need to highlight some important targets. I imagine this oil would be useful for blind companions. Actually this wouldn't help them. And I don't have any other companions either...\nWhen striking someone with this oil applied, they will glow for a long period of time.",
  "journal.toxony.page.oil_basics.5": "This oil is a bit situational but it was a product of examining the properties of Bloodroot. Who knows when I will need to apply this directly to my companions; which I still do not currently have. When striking someone with this oil applied, they will gain temporary fire resistance.",
  "journal.toxony.page.oil_basics.6": "Once these oils are created, they can be applied in two ways. Either by holding the oil in one hand and the item I want to oil in the other, then using the oil pot. Or placing the oil pot down by crouching, then using the placed oil with an item in my hand. Either method will use some of the oil. Don't worry about using it up, the pot still stays and eventually I will produce a method to refill them.",
  "journal.toxony.page.basic_tools.0": "I miss many of my tools used back in the academy. My hands feel idle even if I am churning the ingredients within the mortar all day to pass the time. I am getting antsy for some experimentation. I think it is time to mold all my missing accessories. Using the materials I have mined and my crafting table I think I will be able to re-create all my tools I've lost.",
  "journal.toxony.page.basic_tools.1": "One of my most important devices was created by myself back at the academy. Made with local smiths and the approval of the ethics council (albeit not honestly). It is a masterful device that monitors your chemical composition. Specifically how much of your chemistry is toxic.",
  "journal.toxony.page.basic_tools.2": "\n\n\n\nTo use the device, I simply hold it in my hand (or as a charm on my person) and what will appear is a gauge that displays useful information about my bodies chemical composition. The toxicity gauge examines 3 important parts of my body. The toxins, my tolerance, and the thresholds I can reach!",
  "journal.toxony.page.basic_tools.3": "\n\n\n\nThe green bar displays how much toxins are already in my system. Of course eating or drinking poisonous substances will increase this amount. And if my diet is poison-less, the toxins will very slowly dissipate from my body till none remains. But that isn't the goal is it?",
  "journal.toxony.page.basic_tools.4": "\n\n\n\nAnd as much as I want to experiment with my own chemical makeup, the flesh is weak and the body needs to adapt. The purple bar displays my bodily tolerance of toxin I can hold. Exceed this amount and there are dangerous consequences. I must make sure the green bar never reaches the apex of the purple.",
  "journal.toxony.page.basic_tools.5": "\n\n\n\nThe tolerance is quite important. In order to be able to hold onto more toxins, this purple bar must increase. And to do that, the body must adapt to the poisonous substances. This means I must consume more to slowly build up that bar.",
  "journal.toxony.page.basic_tools.6": "\n\n\n\nIf however, I were to intake a large amount of toxins that exceed my tolerance, then the skull indicator will turn red. This tells me I must detox myself as soon as possible as any extra bit of toxin will consume me, making any bit of my autonomy permanently removed. I can detox with regeneration potions or a golden apple!",
  "journal.toxony.page.basic_tools.7": "This device will help me greatly in my research to come. Especially when I review my research on ancient poison rituals and blends. I need to ensure I don't get too excited and keep this device on me at all times so I don't go over my limits. I have a feeling this device will evolve from being less of a precaution to a wonderful future prospect.",
  "journal.toxony.page.basic_tools.8": "A scalpel may seem like only a tool of medicine, but it is equally as important within chemistry. Its intricate, convenient, and most importantly precise. The scalpel may help me with procuring very delicate material from mobs that a sword could not extract.",
  "journal.toxony.page.basic_tools.9": "A magnifying glass for viewing material closer. This may not be useful at the moment but later on it might be beneficial to have when I start looking deeper into the poisonous materials.",
  "journal.toxony.page.alchemical_warfare.0": "While toiling with oils and poisons, I had an uninvited guest enter my lab. In desperation, I threw my oil directly at the creature. I learned something very useful that day. As a result, I created a sash that allowed me to weaponize oil in another way.",
  "journal.toxony.page.alchemical_warfare.1": "Because of clever design, I can easily add any oil on the sash simply by holding the sash in one hand and an oil pot in the other. Doing so will fill the sash with the contents of the oil pot. Behold, a chemical bomb! It can be used about 16 times. Not as many as I hoped but it will make due. Also, this has given me another brilliant idea.",
  "journal.toxony.page.alchemical_warfare.2": "This complex device Is similar to its cousin the crossbow. However, through extensive research and engineering, I have managed to compact it down to a single-handed crossbow that can fire two additional shots before needing to be loaded.",
  "journal.toxony.page.alchemical_warfare.3": "However, because of its size, its power has been scaled down. To compensate, I have made special ammunition. A catalyst for oil. Using the bolts inside a placed oil pot, it can be covered in oil, applying its effect to hit targets. Do keep in mind some oils will not apply to the bolts.",
  "journal.toxony.page.alchemical_warfare.4": "The Cyclebow can store and fire a sequence of bolts. As such, the order they are fired is determined by when they are placed into the Cyclebow. This trait can make it devastating with different combinations of bolts. However, manually adding each bolt can be cumbersome. It also makes for a terribly unorganized inventory. As a result, I have designed an inexpensive and ingenious method of loading them.",
  "journal.toxony.page.alchemical_warfare.5": "With some inspiration and complex tinkering, I have designed a small container to be able to store a sequence of bolts that retain their order. It can bulk load bolts into the Cyclebow all at once and takes up less space in my inventory than individual stacks of bolts.",
  "journal.toxony.page.alchemical_warfare.6": "To load bolts into the cartridge, crouch and use it. The cartridge will grab different bolts in my inventory, which is determined just like how arrows are when using a bow. It will try to grab bolts from different stacks. If there isn't enough unique stacks, it will grab the same stacks. We can then load the Cyclebow like we do bolts. If I wish to get the bolts back, I only need to crouch and use the filled cartridge.",
  "journal.toxony.page.alchemical_warfare.7": "Toxic paste is extremely unstable. But its volatility will be the highlight of my next alchemical instrument! Potions are too refined, too narrow. By creating a flask that yields greater capacity and putting a little bit of the paste inside, I can make a much more efficient and possibly renewable potion container.",
  "journal.toxony.page.alchemical_warfare.8": "To create the flask, wrap leather around a glass bottle and put toxic paste on the lip of the cork. With this, I have a powerful potion container. One that can not only be used more than once, but also doubles the longevity of the potion effect itself!",
  "journal.toxony.page.alchemical_warfare.9": "To fill the flask, I need another potion in my other hand and then use the flask to pour it inside. Because of how unstable the paste is, I will be able to create a toxic formula that can refill its contents without recompositing another potion. This makes the potions renewable! However, because of its toxins, it has a high toxicity level. Monitor your toxicity levels with the toxicity gauge after repeated use of the flask.",
  "journal.toxony.page.alchemical_warfare.10": "What's even more curious is if I ever get my hands on an enchanting book that roughly translates to \"Refill\", then the contents of my empty flask will be refilled just by sleeping through the night! Although I have my qualms with enchanting, I cannot deny its utility in my experiments!",
  "journal.toxony.page.refined_process.0": "After some hours of crushing, lighting, refining, I have found a way to produce a more stable and pure substance against my messy predecessor. I've learned poison paste becomes more pure when introduced to heat. However, the concentration of heat necessary to produce this effect cannot be obtained through a furnace.",
  "journal.toxony.page.refined_process.1": "As such I was reminded of another tool used for intense heat treatment for any single material. Although it cannot mass-heat many items as well as a furnace can, it will give us enough heat to refine our poison paste to higher potential!",
  "journal.toxony.page.refined_process.2": "The crucible can now be used to heat a single poison paste and turn it into what I call \"Toxic Paste\". The name isn't particularly compelling but it gets the effect across. This is the beginning of true chemistry!",
  "journal.toxony.page.refined_process.3": "Curious about the new refined paste I have created, I found it extremely volatile when introduced to our slimy little friends. The acidic structure of slimes is greatly empowered when using my toxic paste. Naturally I created a very dangerous yet helpful oil mixture that proves invaluable both in combat and in the mines!",
  "journal.toxony.page.refined_process.4": "When this oil is applied to a mob, it will reduce its armor effectiveness by about 25%. This is truly a remarkable achievement, but what's more incredible is its ability to precisely dissolve mineral structure! By throwing it onto ores, we gain more as if it were a fortune 2 pickaxe. This is revolutionizing!",
  "journal.toxony.page.refined_process.5": "My latest experiment came with an unexpected relationship. Specifically with llama spit and ocelot mint. Now with toxic paste, I can combine these ingredients to make an oil capable of smoothing tools to a more desirable state. Repairing old tools has always been so cumbersome, this oil will provide a nice touch up!",
  "journal.toxony.page.refined_process.6": "With toxic paste in my arsenal, I can improve on the techniques of the ancients. I can create a more powerful blend using it. But I must be incredibly careful. My system may not be able to handle it if I haven't already grown accustom.",
  "journal.toxony.page.refined_process.7": "The old methods of mortar and pestle are slow. As such I have created through miraculous engineering a machine to automate the process. Using redstone as its activator, this can take away the monotony of manual pestling off your hands.",
  "journal.toxony.page.refined_process.8": "Once placed, just insert the ingredients inside (Don't forget the item needed to collect it) and send a redstone signal. Each time the machine gains a signal, it will pestle once. Keep sending it repeated signals to pestle over-time. Although this automated method is a tad slower than by hand, it allows for unattended pestling. And if its too slow, just make more!",
  "journal.toxony.page.pure_chemistry.0": "I have been locking myself in for several days. Rationing my resources, burning through old books. I've found something magnificent. This paste I have made has a unique effect after toiling with potions. It seems the nether wart in them are binding their structure. But their attraction is faint. I need a way to purify the process. I think I know what will work.",
  "journal.toxony.page.pure_chemistry.1": "I will need a small glass container. Bottles are too large to precisely measure and are also quite fragile for my intended uses. So I will need to create a smaller vessel for my formulas. I must create a smaller and stronger container!",

  "journal.toxony.page.mutagens.1": "As I have always predicted, these toxins could DO WONDERS in evolving our weak and insolent species.

  "journal.toxony.page.mutagens.4": "However, there is a catch to mutagens. Not all of them are the same, and the one I get greatly depends on the INGREDIENTS I CONSUME. As such when eating substances or making blends, I must be mindful of which ones I eat, as each ingredient contains an affinity for one aspect of the world that another may not share.",
  "journal.toxony.page.mutagens.5": "To discover these affinities within poisonous ingredients, I must do one of two things. Either I consume it in great quantities until I figure it out, which is quite painful. Or something much more efficient.

  "journal.toxony.page.evolved_flora.3": "Alternatively, if I am struggling to find a certain affinity within an ingredient, I can instead FUSE other ones for a variable outcome. I can make a substance that will allow me to gain another affinity from three other poisonous materials. To do this I first must create the mix.",
  "journal.toxony.page.evolved_flora.4": "Next, in order to purify the mix for total reconstruct, I must heat it up in a small contained source.",
  "journal.toxony.page.evolved_flora.5": "Finally, with amalgamation of poisonous material, all I need to do is hold a magnifying glass and interact with the substance. With enough searching I can pinpoint an entirely new affinity associated with this ingredient. Because of the nature of the material, this inefficient method is the best I can manage if I am to remold an entirely new affinity.",
  "journal.toxony.page.advanced_oils.0": "We won't stop at simple oils. We have much more possibilities FOR MORE POTENCY! Toxin has opened new doors to its potential. AND WE WILL USE THEM GRACIOUSLY!",
  "journal.toxony.page.advanced_oils.1": "Using my alembic we can INFUSE our pots from just basic clay to a BEAUTIFUL TOXIN POT. Many of my more potent oils will need this enhanced container. For the simple clay pot was WEAK and shattered under the effects of toxin.",
  "journal.toxony.page.advanced_oils.2": "Toxin Oil! Like its predecessor but WAY MORE VOLATILE. Using toxin as a base we can use a deadly effect that produces a LETHAL result which poison has always lacked. My magnificent creation can now be offered to EVERYONE.",
  "journal.toxony.page.advanced_oils.3": "There are some situations where covering your tracks will be STUPID. As such I have improved on my fatigue oil composition and with some enhancements from TOXIN, I have managed to create this cloudy gas that weakens and blinds in a small area.",
  "journal.toxony.page.advanced_oils.4": "If I feel particularly HORRIBLE, then I may want to produce this regeneration oil pot. Fragrant and REVOLTING to the touch, it does the opposite of what most of my oils do, and as such would be quite appealing to doctors in the field.",
  "journal.toxony.page.advanced_oils.5": "The acid was already potent. LETS MAKE IT MORE! Now with access to stronger ingredients, I can reformulate the acid oil using toxin. As such, the acid effect has been amplified, making it reduce armor strength even more, while gaining the ability to dissolve diamond level ores.",
  "journal.toxony.page.advanced_oils.6": "Blaze power was already as VOLATILE as toxin. It burns just like toxin does. So a thought came to me. Was there a way to mix these substances together to create the ultimate purifying effect. That's when I created this miraculous fusion. WITCHFIRE.",
  "journal.toxony.page.advanced_oils.7": "Now for those empty pots. They can be filled with replacement oil without recreating the composition in the pot. Just by making this base, we can refill all our oil containers and even sashes BEAUTIFUL.",

  "journal.toxony.page.evolving_warfare.1": "A perfect amalgamation of poison and purpose. The leather of animals felt missing something tactile and comfortable. By imbuing it with my toxin, I can create a hardened and more durable material. And it smells of progress all over!",
  "journal.toxony.page.evolving_warfare.2": "An outfit from a bygone age. Their style was very fitting in their time. With some minor-improvements, I've made it coat fit me perfectly. Now for the remaining parts.",
  "journal.toxony.page.evolving_warfare.3": "I must admit, my pants were the most tattered of all my attire. So having fresh leggings is a euphoric feeling. Otherwise the breeze would have made my skin crawl and my nights freezing. ",
  "journal.toxony.page.evolving_warfare.4": "To avoid having fungus feet, some nice pair of boots will be invaluable. Always a fresh pair, except these ones are already infused with my toxin. Almost feel like my feet are being cleansed by the fumes. Plus the pain. ",
  "journal.toxony.page.evolving_warfare.5": "Finally, the centerpiece of the suit. The mask that personified the period. The Plague Mask. Although I've placed a convenient hood over it for days of rain. This mask will greatly benefit the sometimes overpowering toxins.",
  "journal.toxony.page.evolving_warfare.6": "The plague doctor outfit has a rather potent effect. When afflicted by a hazardous ailment such as slowness or blindness, the effect won't last as long. The amount of time the effect is reduced by depends on how many parts of the outfit I am wearing. It can even nullify the effect completely if it already is applied for a very short span of time.",
  "journal.toxony.page.evolving_warfare.7": "needed. Now that I have a much more durable leather, I only need a very durable metal. The strongest I can find to withstand the chemicals. That's when I came across ancient debris. Fitting it is deep within the bowls of the Nether.",
  "journal.toxony.page.evolving_warfare.8": "It was time to expand my arsenal. I have realized the potential Netherite has. So much I could do with such a durable material. And I'll start it with this new Oil Pot Bandolier.",
  "journal.toxony.page.evolving_warfare.9": "With even greater potential in material, I can enhance both the capacity and the duration of the flask even further. Now I can keep the effect for triple the normal length. This power is UNBELIEVABLE!",
