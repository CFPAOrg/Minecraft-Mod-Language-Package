    "A perversion of $(l:hexcasting:patterns/spells/blockworks#hexcasting:edify)$(action)Edify Sapling/$ lets me knit a fabric out of wool and _media. It acts similar to a $(l:hexcasting:items/thought_knot)$(item)Thought-Knot/$, but can only hold _Hexes — standard iotas fizzle instead of embedding themselves in the fabric. Additionally, the weave, radiating with raw energy, can passively exert force on nearby _media, with no mind involved — nothing as powerful as a _Hex, but still useful nonetheless."
