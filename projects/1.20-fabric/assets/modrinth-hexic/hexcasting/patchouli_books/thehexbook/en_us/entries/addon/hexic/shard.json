    "Ever since acquiring a few $(item)Echo Shards/$ from one of those ancient cities, my _Hexes have felt... restrained in a way, as if the shards were trying to absorb them. Holding a shard in my other hand would let it do so, and would let me release all of the patterns I've drawn at once.",
    "This behavior seems rather useful for quickly casting prepared spells. For example, if I let my shard absorb a simple raycast Hex, I could release it all-at-once against an entity rather than having to catch it off-guard standing still. Patterns released from an $(item)Echo Shard/$ are cast against my staff stack, letting me use the newly-found entity by hand."
