  "hexchanting.page.imbuing.0": "I have found uses for many of Nature's resources outside of my work with _Hexes, such as the construction of tools and armaments. It follows that I am able to do the same with amethyst. If I can align the crystalline structure correctly they can even channel media to cast Hexes.",
  "hexchanting.page.imbuing.1": "After experimentation I have found that charged amethyst works best when crafting equipment. By substituting it for a material like iron or diamond I can craft items with comparable performance to their diamond equivalents, though less durable. Their true strength is how they interact with the world. When used they resonate with the surrounding media, providing a guide for hexes channeled through them.",
  "hexchanting.page.imbuing.2": "Compromises have had to be made in the creation of these tools. They must be fed with external media when casting else they will cannibalize their own materials, possibly to the point of destruction. This is similar to a $(l:items/hexcasting)$(item)Cypher/$, though these tools can be recharged.",
  "hexchanting.page.imbuing.3": "Regular use also slowly drains this reservoir - I believe the media is being expended healing damage to the structure of the amethyst. Conventional means of equipment repair have proved ineffective due to difficulties in integrating a new matrix into the existing crystal.",
  "hexchanting.page.imbuing.4": "My attempts to craft a bow on similar principles have failed. Amethyst simply doesn't have the flexibility required. I have instead resorted to crafting arrows with amethyst shards, in place of flint. These can be imbued like my other amethyst equipment but they can only draw on their internal media, which is comparable to an amethyst shard. I am sure I could craft an equivalent out of media alone, but there are niches where I may find this useful.",
  "hexchanting.page.imbue_equipment.summary.0": "Imbues the supplied hexes into the item in my other hand, so that they will be cast whenever the item is used.",
  "hexchanting.page.imbue_equipment.summary.1": "For tools (axes, hoes, pickaxes and shovels) this triggers after breaking a block. The stack is initialized with the location of the broken block. Break block spells cast through this tool behave as if broken by the tool, which includes any enchantment effects. Swords cast on hit and push the targeted entity to the stack.",
  "hexchanting.page.imbue_equipment.summary.2": "Armour is more complicated: it casts when the wearer takes damage and pushes the attacking entity, source entity, position and amount to the stack. All but the last may be null, as Nature perceives things in strange ways. Arrows cast when they hit an entity, pushing themself and their target to the stack."
