Additionally attempting to block with it momentarily charges up the Amel like with the Amel-Infused Diamond Sword for a quarter of a second, and if hit at that point the Amel lashes out. I guess I could call this ability \"parrying\".",
    "pages.lapisworks.imbuement_swords.iron.desc2": "The Amel lashes out towards the other person and absorbs some pieces gaining 20 \"points\" of durability. It also hits the enemy with half the power of the sword (launching them away from me as well). If their tool breaks, it steals every piece, gaining 100 \"points\" instead of just 20. Additonally the enemy feels their tool was hit so hard they have to make sure it's not completely broken for a second or two, almost always.",
    "pages.lapisworks.imbuement_swords.iron.desc3": "The Amel has enough energy that it can even withstand an axe hit and go straight for its handle, making the enemy tool take 100 \"points\" of damage instead of just 20. However if I fail to parry the axe $(o)My$() tool takes 20 \"points\" of damage and $(o)I$() get flung away.

    "pages.lapisworks.imbuement_swords.gold.desc": "Gold is a media insulator, so I can't quite infuse Amel into a sword made of it. Still, Amel is a natural toxin to most living beings so I can pour over it and attempt to infuse it so it doesn't slide right off. Hitting entities with this makes the Amel lash out and go into them (destroying a relatively major piece of the sword as well), poisoning them for about ten seconds. Quite a nice glass cannon if I say so myself.",

He needed a way to be able to deal with all of them from a huge distance or from a few floors up. Greater Sentinel's range was much too small, they would be aware it was a small trap.
