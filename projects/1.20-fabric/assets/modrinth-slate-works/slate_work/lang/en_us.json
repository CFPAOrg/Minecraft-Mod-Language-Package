  "slate_work.page.storage_loci.1": "As wonderful as $(thing)Vessels/$ are for storage, they have an... opaque method of interaction.

Importantly, these all $(l:casting/mishaps2)mishap when not cast in a Spell Circle/$. $(br2)$(br)$(o)“Riddles,” I said. $(br)“Always preferable to no answer at all,” he responded.",
  "slate_work.page.storage_loci.2": "To elaborate more, $(thing)Vessels/$ respects Nature's silly rules regarding the \"Stack Limit\" by working around them. Rather than directly calling an item based on its name, I more-or-less supply a \"description;\" this is a _Hex that takes an $(l:patterns/scrying/item)Item Stack Iota/$, and needs to return a boolean. Also, all patterns to do with the retrieving of $(thing)Storage Vessels/$ take a copy of the Stack, and puts it onto the 'inner' stack (much like $(l:patterns/meta#hexcasting:for_each)$(action)Thoth's Gambit/$).",
  "slate_work.page.storage_loci.get_storage": "This simply returns what $(thing)Vessels/$ the current $(l:greatwork/spellcircles)Spell Circle/$ has activated. I should likely use this to check if the $(l:greatwork/spellcircles)Spell Circle/$ has collected any $(thing)Vessels/$.",
  "slate_work.page.storage_loci.store_item": "It is much easier to store an item into a $(thing)Vessel/$ than to pull it out. This pattern simply takes an Item Entity, and neatly sorts it into the activated $(thing)Storage Vessels/$. Costs an 1/8th of a $(l:items/amethyst)dust/$ per activated $(thing)Vessel/$.",
  "slate_work.page.storage_loci.get_item": "This takes a _Hex and runs it on every $(l:patterns/scrying/item)Item Stack/$ stored (with it on top of the stack). Once the _Hex is executed, it requires a $(thing)Integer/$, $(thing)Vector/$, and $(thing)Boolean/$, left on the stack, in that order.",
  "slate_work.page.storage_loci.get_item_cont": "Further explained: this runs the given _Hex on every stored Item in the $(thing)Vessels/$. The _Hex must return (top to bottom) either a False (omits the Vector, and Number) or True, Vector, and Number. The Vector corresponds to where to output the items into the world (respecting ambit), and Number relates to how many of that type of item to retrieve. $(br2)Costs a 1/4th of a $(l:items/amethyst)dust/$ per activated $(thing)Vessel/$.",
  "slate_work.page.storage_loci.check_item": "Check Item functions much like Reawaken Item; however, it only requires a Boolean from the inputted _Hex. If the Boolean is ever True, the spell ends, and returns True.",
  "slate_work.page.storage_loci.sort_items": "In some rare scenarios, $(thing)Vessels/$ can get jumbled up and have items of the same type spread across different  $(thing)Vessels/$. This is a neat spell to resort them at a cost. That cost being 5 $(l:items/amethyst)Charged Amethyst/$.",

  "slate_work.page.storage_loci_block.storage_loci_cont": "While $(thing)Storage Vessels/$ can only hold 16 \"types\" of items each (much like a single chest holding only 27 slots), they ignore the standard stack limit, holding a near-infinite amount of each slot! $(br2)Additionally, as a $(l:greatwork/spellcircles)Spell Circle/$ activates these with its high-density $(thing)Media Wave/$, the $(l:greatwork/spellcircles)Circle/$ gains the ability to read and retrieve items from the $(thing)Storage Vessels/$ (stacking as more are activated). I have noted down the Spells for doing just that $(l:patterns/spells/storage_loci)here/$.",
  "slate_work.page.storage_loci_block.dropping": "Important to note: when $(thing)Storage Vessels/$ are broken, they do not eject the items stored within.

This feels almost like Nature is toying with me, since there is no way to pull items directly out of a $(thing)Storage Vessel/$... I will admit however, it is handy to see what I have with a glance.",

  "slate_work.page.ambit_loci.ambit_loci": "The $(thing)Ambit Extender/$ is a fabulous answer to my $(thing)Ambit/$ woes when it comes to $(l:greatwork/spellcircles)Spell Circles/$.

  "slate_work.page.ambit_loci.crafting": "Since the $(thing)Ambit Extender/$ operates on $(thing)Ambit/$, having a \"core\" block that can operate on $(thing)Media Waves/$ would be beneficial.

  "slate_work.page.speed_loci.speed_loci": "As I begin to explore the uses of the $(l:greatwork/spellcircles)Great Work/$, I find my self needing more control over these fascinating possibilities. So I have created the $(thing)Wave Regulator/$; what this does is it pops a number from the stack, and attempts to set the \"speed\" of the wave. More specifically, how many 20ths of a second the wave should wait before going to the next slate.",
  "slate_work.page.speed_loci.speed_loci_cont": "This system does have some limitations however. For one, it cannot set the speed to be faster than the wave could possibly move, doing nothing if I try to set the speed higher. Explained, it can only set the time to wait to any number above or equal the $(l:greatwork/spellcircles)circle's/$ default acquired speed, or back to its regular speed. To do this, the $(thing)Wave Regulator/$ needs to pop a 0 from the stack, and it gives the $(l:greatwork/spellcircles)Spell Circle/$ full control of the $(thing)Media Wave/$ again.",
  "slate_work.page.speed_loci.crafting": "$(thing)Wave Regulators/$ are odd in their construction compared to the rest of my... $(o)Gifted/$ visions.

  "slate_work.page.crafting_loci.crafting_loci_cont": "Precisely what the $(thing)Patterned Assembler/$ does is it attempts to craft whatever item is set within, pulling from activated $(l:greatwork/storage_loci_block)Storage Vessels/$, and placing the resulting item(s) back into the $(thing)Vessels/$. This is triggered when the $(thing)Assembler/$ is activated with a $(l:greatwork/spellcircles)Spell Circle/$. The recipe can be set by hand, or via a $(l:patterns/spells/storage_loci#slate_work:set_craft)Spell/$. If it can craft the inscribed item, it returns a True to the stack and crafts the item, else it does not craft the item (not enough ingredients, no recipe, etc) and returns a False.",

  "slate_work.page.macro_loci.macro_loci": "During my travels I have heard mutterances about things called \"macros,\" patterns that represent larger _Hexes (I believe these to be linked to a possible $(l:greatwork/akashiclib)Akashic Library/$?). Nonetheless, I am able to recreate these \"macros\" with Spell Circles using the $(thing)Spell Imprinter/$, and an iota written inside of a $(l:items/focus)any iota holder/$ placed on top of the $(thing)Imprinter/$.",
  "slate_work.page.macro_loci.macro_loci_cont": "When this is activated by a $(l:greatwork/spellcircles)Spell Circle/$, it binds the$(br)currently set pattern to the iota stored within the held item (which can be set via a $(l:patterns/spells/storage_loci#slate_work:set_macro)spell/$). Thus whenever the pattern is inscribed into slate and activated, it instead runs the iota rather than the written pattern.

  "slate_work.page.macro_loci.crafting": "Despite the horrors this possibly ascertains... this is still an advantageous block to obtain. I believe a $(thing)Weaponsmith villager/$ would be the best fit. This is due to their adeptness at reworking broken weapons to new, sharper instruments.",
