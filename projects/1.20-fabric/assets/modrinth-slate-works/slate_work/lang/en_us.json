Rather than directly calling an item based on its name, I more-or-less supply a \"description;\" this is a _Hex that takes an $(l:patterns/scrying/item)Item Stack Iota/$, and needs to return a boolean. Also, all patterns to do with the retrieving of $(thing)Storage Vessels/$ take a copy of the Stack, and puts it onto the 'inner' stack (much like $(l:patterns/meta#hexcasting:for_each)$(action)Thoth's Gambit/$).",

  "slate_work.page.storage_loci.get_item": "This takes a _Hex and runs it on every $(l:patterns/scrying/item)Item Stack/$ stored (with it on top of the stack). Once the _Hex is executed, it requires a $(thing)Integer/$, $(thing)Vector/$, and $(thing)Boolean/$, left on the stack, in that order.",
  "slate_work.page.storage_loci.get_item_cont": "Further explained: this runs the given _Hex on every stored Item in the $(thing)Vessels/$. The _Hex must return (top to bottom) either a False (omits the Vector, and Number) or True, Vector, and Number. The Vector corresponds to where to output the items into the world (respecting ambit), and Number relates to how many of that type of item to retrieve. $(br2)Costs a 1/4th of a $(l:items/amethyst)dust/$ per activated $(thing)Vessel/$.",

  "slate_work.page.ambit_loci.crafting": "Since the $(thing)Ambit Extender/$ operates on $(thing)Ambit/$, having a \"core\" block that can operate on $(thing)Media Waves/$ would be beneficial.

  "slate_work.page.speed_loci.speed_loci": "As I begin to explore the uses of the $(l:greatwork/spellcircles)Great Work/$, I find my self needing more control over these fascinating possibilities. So I have created the $(thing)Wave Regulator/$; what this does is it pops a number from the stack, and attempts to set the \"speed\" of the wave. More specifically, how many 20ths of a second the wave should wait before going to the next slate.",
  "slate_work.page.speed_loci.speed_loci_cont": "This system does have some limitations however. For one, it cannot set the speed to be faster than the wave could possibly move, doing nothing if I try to set the speed higher. Explained, it can only set the time to wait to any number above or equal the $(l:greatwork/spellcircles)circle's/$ default acquired speed, or back to its regular speed. To do this, the $(thing)Wave Regulator/$ needs to pop a 0 from the stack, and it gives the $(l:greatwork/spellcircles)Spell Circle/$ full control of the $(thing)Media Wave/$ again.",
  "slate_work.page.speed_loci.crafting": "$(thing)Wave Regulators/$ are odd in their construction compared to the rest of my... $(o)Gifted/$ visions.

  "slate_work.page.crafting_loci.crafting_loci_cont": "Precisely what the $(thing)Patterned Assembler/$ does is it attempts to craft whatever item is set within, pulling from activated $(l:greatwork/storage_loci_block)Storage Vessels/$, and placing the resulting item(s) back into the $(thing)Vessels/$. This is triggered when the $(thing)Assembler/$ is activated with a $(l:greatwork/spellcircles)Spell Circle/$. The recipe can be set by hand, or via a $(l:patterns/spells/storage_loci#slate_work:set_craft)Spell/$.

Thus whenever the pattern is inscribed into slate and activated, it instead runs the iota rather than the written pattern.
