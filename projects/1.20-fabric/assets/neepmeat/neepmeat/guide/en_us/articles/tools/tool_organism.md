# Tool Organism

The tool organism provides self-repair faculties to the tool it bonds with.

It can be applied to any item with durability with a PLC using the COMBINE operation.

It can replace the pneumatic motor on a Drill Chassis, allowing it to run without a nearby compressor.

# Refuelling

A tool organism runs on metabolic substrates such as Meat, Animal Feed or Liquid Food. Refilling can be done with a Bottler, or by right-clicking a tank.

# Energy Values

- Animal Feed: 500 durability per bucket
- Meat: 750 durability per bucket
- Liquid Food: 81000 * hunger / 600
