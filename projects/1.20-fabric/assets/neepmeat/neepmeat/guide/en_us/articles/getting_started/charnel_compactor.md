# Charnel Compactor

The Charnel Compactor produces Body Compound from raw meat. This coming together of diverse tissues is a sacrament. With the Integrator's blessing, dead things can be half-imbued with life and can go on to create all manner of new machines.

## Usage

Like a composter, raw materials can be inserted by right-clicking or through hoppers and pipes into the top of the block. If the compactor is full and connected to an Integrator via Data Cables, a Integration Fluid Compound Cartridge will be produced. This can be extracted via hoppers and pipes from the block's bottom face.
