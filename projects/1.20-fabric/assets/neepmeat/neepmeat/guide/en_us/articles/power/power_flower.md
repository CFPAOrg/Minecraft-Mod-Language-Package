# Power Flower

The Power Flower is an organism that can synthesise Transient Ichor from sunlight and by liquid food.

## Usage

Power Flower Seeds can be placed on any dirt-like block and will eventually mature into a larger growth. When a growth block has air above it and one or more growth blocks below it, it will specialise into a photosynthetic organ and produce 20eJ/t constantly. Otherwise, it will increase the rate at which foods are digested and metabolised.

Water inserted through a Power Flower Fluid Port is necessary for photosynthesis.

## Foods

Each non-photosynthetic organ (full block) will consume 1d of food per tick. Consumption and generation rate therefore depend on the number of full blocks.

- Meat: 3eJ/t per droplet consumed
- Animal Feed: 4eJ/t per droplet consumed
- Food: (1 + hunger) eJ/t per droplet consumed
