# Mincer

The Mincer provides a compact means of converting substrate organisms into Tissue Slurry.

# Usage

Substrate organisms must be inserted into the machine's jaws from above. Tissue Slurry can be extracted from the lower block for further purification with a Trommel. A running motor must be connected to the base for this machine to function.

The amount of Tissue Slurry produced by a substrate organism is dependent on its size.
