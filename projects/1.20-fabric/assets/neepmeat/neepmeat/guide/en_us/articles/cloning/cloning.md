*The essential Saltes of Animals may be so prepared and preserved, that an ingenious Man may have the whole Ark of Noah in his own Studie, and raise the fine Shape of an Animal out of its Ashes at his Pleasure.*
                                         - Borellus

To obtain the *Essential Saltes* of an organism, it must be exposed to an Ash Preparation potion and then incinerated. This procedure will succeed even if the organism has an innate resistance to fire, but the disassembly will have to be manual.

*Essential Saltes* can be used in an Oviparous Synthesiser to produce eggs.
