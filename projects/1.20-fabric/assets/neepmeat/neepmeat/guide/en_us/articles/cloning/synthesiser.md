# Oviparous Synthesiser

To cast off the vestige of nature is to inch towards revelation; to replicate the natural forms of flesh - finding wisdom in their madness - is to step towards Enlightenment.

## Usage

The Oviparous Synthesiser creates eggs of a template organism through its *Essential Saltes* Right-clicking the machine with the corresponding *Essential Saltes* will install or remove the template.

In order to operate, the machine must be fed Meat. The amount of meat to produce an egg varies depending on the size of the organism.

Production of eggs can be temporarily disabled with a redstone signal.

## Eggs

Eggs can be moved in standard ways, such as with water streams and pistons. They can also be picked up as items by hitting them. 

- Immersion in blood will allow eggs to hatch. 
- Injecting blood directly using a PLC will trigger immediate hatching.
