# Integrator Organism

An Integrator is a biomechanical information processing system intended to ease the production of machines. Designed to withstand high quantities of inhuman knowledge, Integrators can confer this information to certain substances, ascending them to Enlightened forms.

## Acquisition

The technology to produce Integrators is long-lost, but their eggs can still be found in dungeons and other hidden places.

Alternatively, offering a Reanimated Heart to the receiver configuration below might cause one to appear.

To hatch an Integrator Egg, put it in a comfy place and pump in a bucketful of blood using fluid pipes. After a short time, the Integrator will hatch.

## Usage

Each Integrator has an internal information storage that is gradually filled as it listens to the cosmos. Feeding the organism with Whisper Flour accelerate learning.
