# Transductive Cannula

The Transductive Cannula imbues a working substrate with received heat, producing Transient Ichor.

## Usage

The Transductive Cannula must be incorporated into the structure shown below. It must be placed above a tank of water with a heat source below. Heat sources include lit furnaces, lava, lava cauldrons and magma blocks, although lit furnaces provide the most energy. 
Ethereal fuel is ejected at pressure from the top of the dome.

Reservoirs can provide a steady source of water.
