# Thord

# Stack

Unlike NEEPASM, the syntax for stack manipulation is much more concise.

To push a number to the stack, it is simply stated. As Thord does not care about newlines or expression separators, multiple numbers can be pushed on the same line.

Consider the following program:

```
# Push the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 to the stack,
# Add them all together and print
1 2 3 4 + + + .
```

In NEEPASM, the above program would look like this:

```
push 1
push 2
push 3
push 4
add
add
add
say
```

# Words

Words are Thord's equivalent of functions. They contain a sequence of operations that can be reused.

A word definition starts with ':' followed by the word's name. The definition is terminated with a ';'.

```
# Adds one to the previous stack entry and prints it.
: aword 1 + . ;

# Invoke the word
1 aword
```

# Inline NEEPASM

Inline NEEPASM operations can be included in a Thord program. The inline operation must be the first thing on that line, or be prefixed with a '.'.

```
label l

.jmp l ; # valid

jmp l # also valid
```

Unlike Thord words, the operation's arguments are parsed until the line ends or a ';' is encountered.

```
# Inline NEEPASM
robot @(-10 -60 11 U)

# Thord while loop
begin
  # Thord words can be referenced like NEEPASM labels.
  ihandler @(-12 -60 14 U) request
  iwait
-1 # Push -1 (true) to loop endlessly 
until 

# Define the word 'request'
: request
  route @(-12 -60 12 W) @(-10 -60 13 E) "*:stone"  
  .
;
```
