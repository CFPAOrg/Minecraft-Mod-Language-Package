# Trommel

This trommel lifts impurities from fats and meats as others might remove rocks from water. Mundane contaminants remain within the rotating mesh while the desired products drain away.

Dirty Ore Fat can be processed in the Trommel for an approximate 150% yield compared to directly pressing dirty fat.

Tissue fluid produced via the disassembly of substrate organisms with a Large Mincer or Death Blades can be separated into Refined Meat with an extra chance of Assorted Biological Solids.

# Usage

Fluid is taken from any container placed top of the nearest block and outputs leave through the bottom of the far end.
