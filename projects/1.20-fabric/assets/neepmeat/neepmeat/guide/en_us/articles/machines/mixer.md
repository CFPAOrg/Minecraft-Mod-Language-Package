# Mixer

The Mixer is a two block tall machine that combines fluids and items. It requires a source of rotation to function.

## Usage

Fluid inputs are taken from any tanks that are adjacent to the mixer's lower block. Item inputs must be inserted directly into the machine through hoppers or pipes. 

Once a valid combination of items and fluids is present, the mixing will begin. The rate of this process is determined by the speed of the connected motor.
