# Rendering Basin

The enlightened enzymes of the Gland Potato concentrate the fleshly nature of certain minerals into a layer of ethereal fat. Thus, rendering is an efficacious form of mineral extraction.

# Usage

To obtain ore fat, fill a Rendering Basin with eldritch enzymes and drop in raw ore from above. The ore fat will appear within an adjacent Fat Collector from which it can be extracted. Each unit of raw ore requires 333mb of Eldritch Enzymes to process.

Rendering typically yields 20% more of the resource than smelting. Ingots can be formed from the dirty fat using a Hydraulic Press and a Pressing Basin.
