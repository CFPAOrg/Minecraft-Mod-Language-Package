# Mining Tools

NEEPMeat tools and ore processing are different to Vanilla Minecraft, the main difference being that the ore processing pipeline uses ore blocks, rather than raw ores.

## Drill Chassis

The Drill Chassis is a modular mining tool. By default, it has a Pneumatic Motor and runs on compressed air. This means that it must be within 25 blocks of a Small Compressor to run. Mobile compressors are available in two forms:

- Compressor Minecart
- Compressor Scutter - follows the player that placed it

The drill's core implant can be replaced with a Tool Organism using a PLC. This allows the drill to run on liquid food sources, such as Animal Feed and Liquid Food.

The Drill Chassis is also compatible with Meatgun Modules. Heads and modules can be swapped with a Tinker Table.

## Drill Heads

- Reciprocating Head - instantly mines stone-like blocks
- Rotary head - works like a pickaxe, except ore blocks **drop themselves instead of raw ore**
