# Pylon

When at operating speed, the Pylon's emanations stimulate the pineal glands of nearby vertebrates. This permits limited glimpses of the unseen. For unknown reasons, this process can also grant unseen forms substance in the waking world.

## Usage

The Pylon requires a motor facing upwards beneath it. To achieve operating speed, the motor must run at 240eJ/t or above. When at operating speed, the rotor will turn from red to purple.
An active Pylon within a 17 block range of an Advanced Integrator will allow its information reserves to exceed 8GeB.

Efficiency can be increased by adding a pyramid of Meat Steel Blocks below the pylon. This does not have to be solid.

The emanations of the pylon have a highly debilitating Enlightening effect that is partially permanent. Do not go within three blocks of an active Pylon that has a large base.

After a second of exposure to a Pylon, endermen will temporarily lose their ability to teleport.
