## BLANK ( -- )

\cat{return_stack}
# Return Stack

## >R ( n1 -- ) (R: -- n1 )

Moves the top stack entry to the top of the return stack.

## 2>R ( n1 n2 -- ) (R: -- n1 n2 )

Moves the top two entries to the top of the return stack.

## R> (-- n1 ) (R: n1 -- )

Moves the top return stack entry to the top of the data stack.

## 2R> (-- n1 n2 ) (R: n1 n2 -- )

Moves the top two return stack entries to the top of the data stack.

## R@ ( -- n1 ) (R: n1 -- n1 )

Copies the top return stack entry to the data stack.

\cat{flow_control}
# Flow Control

Emits the END instruction, which stops execution. Useful as a placeholder for backpatching. Equivalent to NEEPASM `END`.

## IF ( n1 -- ) (immediate)

Jumps to the next appropriate occurrence of `ELSE` or `THEN`.

```
1 if 
    say "yes"
else
    say "no"
endif
```

## ELSE ( -- ) (immediate)

Provides an alternative branch if the argument of `IF` was false.

## ENDIF ( -- ) (immediate)

Closes an if or if-then construct.

## THEN ( -- ) (immediate)

Same as `ENDIF`.

## BEGIN ( -- ) (immediate)

Marks the start of a begin-until construct.

```
begin
    say "loop forever"
1 until
```

## UNTIL ( n1 -- ) (immediate)

Marks the end of a begin-until construct. Consumes the last stack entry and branches back to the previous `BEGIN` if it is true.

## FOR ( n1 n2 -- ) (immediate)

Begins a do-loop construct. Terminated by `LOOP` or `+LOOP`.

Checks n1 and n2 for equality and branches to the end of the loop if this is the case. Otherwise, the values are moved to the return stack and the loop begins.

The following code section will repeat until loop index reaches n1, starting at n2.

```
10 0 do i . loop
```

## LOOP ( -- ) (immediate)

Increments loop index and branches to the start of the loop if it is lower than the upper bound.

## +LOOP ( n1 -- ) (immediate)

Adds the top stack entry to loop index and branches to the start of the loop if it is lower than the upper bound.

```
10 0 do i . 2 +loop
```

## I ( -- n1 )

Copies the loop index to the data stack. Identical to `R@` in this implementation.

\cat{arithmetic}
# Arithmetic

## + ( n1 n2 -- result )

Adds the top two stack entries. Equivalent to NEEPASM `ADD`.

## - ( n1 n2 -- result )

Subtracts n2 from n1. Equivalent to NEEPASM `SUB`.

## * ( n1 n2 -- result )

Multiplies n1 and n2. Equivalent to NEEPASM `MUL`.

## / ( n1 n2 -- result )

Divides n1 by n2. Equivalent to NEEPASM `DIV`. Produces incorrect results if n2 is 0.

## NEG ( n1 -- result )

Inverts the sign of the top stack entry.

## INVERT (n1 -- result )

Inverts all bits of the top stack entry.

\cat{comparison}
# Comparison

## = ( n1 n2 -- result )

Tests n1 and n2 for equality. Returns -1 if true and 0 if false. Equivalent to NEEPASM `EQ`.

## < ( n1 n2 -- result )

Tests if n1 is less than n2. Equivalent to NEEPASM `LT`.

## < ( n1 n2 -- result )

Tests if n1 is greater than n2. Equivalent to NEEPASM `GT`.

## <= ( n1 n2 -- result )

Tests if n1 is less than or equal to n2. Equivalent to NEEPASM `LTEQ`.

## >= ( n1 n2 -- result )

Tests if n1 is greater than or equal to n2. Equivalent to NEEPASM `GTEQ`.
