    "lessertp.page.lessertp.introduction": "I am unable to cast the Great Spell Greater Teleport, as I do not have a scroll from the very careless people of old (a spell is a spell, damn it!) to help me. That irked me, so I attempted the creation of my own pattern to allow me to teleport in any way unlike Blink, even if it is weaker than what I wish for.",
    "lessertp.page.lessertp.introduction2": "The end result is a stupendously underpowered pattern which is also very cheap. Nature does not like my meddling, it seems. I may have also fallen to my hubris. I should get more experienced before dabbling in creating my own versions of Great Spells again.",
    "lessertp.page.lessertp.summary": "Pass in an entity within ambit and a vec, and the entity's fractional position will change to the vector (clamped). A number means a vec with all the components set to it. Negligible cost, but disappointing.",
    "lessertp.page.simplertp.title": "Simpler Teleport",
    "lessertp.page.simplertp.introduction": "With my recent $(thing)Grand Awakening$(), I felt more confident in my ability to mold and manipulate patterns. This time I've decided to use the Greater Teleport spell as a base, and then size it down. The result is a better omni-directional teleportation pattern than Lesser Teleport.",
    "lessertp.page.simplertp.summary": "Takes an entity that will be within my ambit before and after teleportation and an offset vector, the length of which must be no greater than 10. Teleports the entity in that direction. Costs one shard."
