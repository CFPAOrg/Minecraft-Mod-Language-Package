    "lessertp.page.lessertp.introduction": "I am unable to cast the Great Spell Greater Teleport, as I do not have a scroll from the very careless people of old (a spell is a spell, damn it!) to help me. That irked me, so I attempted the creation of my own pattern to allow me to teleport in any way unlike Blink, even if it is weaker than what I wish for.",
    "lessertp.page.lessertp.introduction2": "The end result is a stupendously underpowered pattern which is also very cheap. Nature does not like my meddling, it seems. I may have also fallen to my hubris. I should get more experienced before dabbling in creating my own versions of Great Spells again.",
    "lessertp.page.lessertp.summary": "Pass in an entity (within ambit) and a vector, and the entity's fractional position will change to the vector (clamped). A number means a vector with all its components as that vector. Negligible cost, but disappointing."
