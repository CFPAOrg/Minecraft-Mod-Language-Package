  "hexstruction.page.structures.0": "Inspired by my ability to both break and place blocks, I've devised a method to expand those capabilities. By breaking down a portion of the world itself into the mere concept of that space, I can store entire regions in my mind as a Structure iota, which I can manipulate and place back into the world. Unfortunately, it appears nature rejects my attempts to store $(l:basics/geodes)$(item)Budding Amethyst/$ and its ilk.",
  "hexstruction.page.structures.1": "Nature prefers to conserve matter; as a result, every copy of the same Structure iota will reference the same structure. Once one is used to place the structure back into the world, no other copy will be able to do the same. Coercing the iota to a boolean will return whether or not the iota remains valid. When \"devouring\" a structure from the world, it appears to define an \"origin\" at the lower North-West corner of the supplied bounds. This appears to remain true even after applying any number of transformations to the structure.",
