ME Threshold Export Bus works when the quantity of an item that stored in ME network is above/below the threshold.

## Example

![GUI](../pic/thr_bus_gui1.png)

The threshold of copper is set to 128, so it exports copper when the stored copper in network is over 128.

![GUI](../pic/thr_bus_gui2.png)

The threshold is same as above, but the mode is set to BELOW. it exports copper when the stored copper is below 128.
