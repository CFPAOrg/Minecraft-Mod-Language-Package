# ME Active Formation Plane

<GameScene zoom="8" background="transparent">
  <ImportStructure src="../structure/cable_active_formation_plane.snbt"></ImportStructure>
</GameScene>

ME Active Formation Plane is a <ItemLink id="ae2:formation_plane" /> that can place block or drop items actively.

You don't need to set up a subnet for it. It works like an <ItemLink id="ae2:export_bus" /> but place block instead of
outputting it to a chest.
