  "oneironaut.page.dimteleport.2": "If I use this to return to a dimension that I previously left within the same instant, the cost drops to five amethyst dust, as the spell can take advantage of a lingering strand of media leading back to my original position. Otherwise, it will attempt to find a safe spot to deposit me, potentially conjuring a block to prevent me from falling to my doom.$(br2)Strangely, I feel an odd sense of acceleration when transporting myself this way, along some incomprehensible axis.",
  "oneironaut.page.infusemedia.1": "Accepts a vector and infuses media into the corresponding block in order to transmute it. Cost and exact effect vary depending on target.",
  "oneironaut.page.infusemedia.2": "Conceptually, this spell is quite similar to $(l:patterns/spells/blockworks#hexcasting:edify)Edify Sapling$(/l).$(br)However, the media that the target block receives is far more finely-tuned, and can thus achieve far more interesting results.",
  "oneironaut.page.wisp_lanterns.1": "I've found that by using materials unique to the Noosphere, I can create a special jar capable of producing and containing a tiny wisp. While this wisp cannot cast anything, it emits quite a bit of light, and will mimic pigments shown to it.$(br)I can also craft a version with tinted glass, in case the wisp's light would disrupt my study's aesthetic.",

To capture a wisp, I must simply use the item on a wisp, and it will be sucked into the housing(assuming it has sufficient media and does not already contain a wisp).",

  "oneironaut.page.wisp_lanterns.7": "To initalize the device's media battery, I must use it on one of my own wisps, which will irretrievably consume it and set the battery's capacity to the wisp's stored media value, rounded up to the nearest dust. Should I wish to reset this (along with everything else about the device), I can simply place it in a crafting grid on its own.",

  "oneironaut.page.noosphere_materials.3": "A large crystal of media much like amethyst, but not quite the same. Produces a buzzing sensation under my fingers when I touch it, as if its media is stimulating the nerves. Breaking it without special care causes it to shatter into 1-4 pieces.",

  "oneironaut.page.noosphere_materials.5": "A solid form of media which is created when Thought Slurry freezes in a media-rich environment, or is caused to freeze by a hex.$(br)Its surface seems to have negative friction, causing anything sliding on it to accelerate indefinitely (albeit slowly).",
  "oneironaut.page.noosphere_materials.6": "An extremely viscous mass of media, capable of very basic cognition, analagous to a slime mold. While it is normally quite lethargic, it uses a spell-like ability to attempt to ensnare anything that touches it.",
  "oneironaut.page.slipway_hint.1": "The slipways, they must lead $(o)somewhere$(). Wisps do not simply manifest from nothing. No matter what I try, I cannot insert so much as a finger through that chaotic rift.$(br2)I'm going about this wrong.

  "oneironaut.page.rod.1": "I've discovered that I can craft a peculiar sort of casting item, using the strange shards found in ancient cities.$(br)This item is unusual in that it casts its imbued hex twenty times per second while I concentrate on it, until it either mishaps or I cast Finale or Encore. This initiates a cooldown period, usually about one second.",

  "oneironaut.page.rod.15": "Returns whether the caster is currently using a rod, regardless of the current cast is from that rod.",
  "oneironaut.page.rod.16": "Echo shards can also be used in the construction of a staff, though it seems the only special property of such a staff is making sculk sounds.",
  "oneironaut.page.miscpatterns.1": "I've found a couple patterns designed to interact with item frames. Nothing fancy, but they're nice utility for things like controlling my spell circles.$(br2)Additionally, it seems Sorter's Purification works on them just fine, so my attempts to find a dedicated frame-item pattern were pointless.",
  "oneironaut.page.miscpatterns.2": "Accepts an item frame entity, and returns its rotation, from 0 to 7.",

  "oneironaut.page.miscpatterns.1.formerlink": "$(l:hexal:patterns/types#hexal:type/block_item)",
  "oneironaut.page.super_budding.1": "I've found that the amethyst-like material native to the noosphere can be imbued with a villager's mind, much like normal amethyst. What's more, the block that results from this process produces significantly more media than normal Budding Amethyst, and it can be picked up and moved if one takes special care.",
  "oneironaut.page.super_budding.2": "Pseudoamethyst requires a stronger mind than normal amethyst, but the cost is well worth it.",
  "oneironaut.page.super_budding.3": "Additionally, when cultivated in the Noosphere, budding pseudoamethyst will produce pseudoamethyst clusters rather than conventional amethyst. These clusters will of course yield pseudoamethyst shards, as well as an unstable form of pseudoamethyst containing about four times as much media as the regular shards. Unfortunately, due to this instability, it cannot be directly converted into usable media. However, it can be converted into many other forms of media crystal by simply bringing the two items together.",
  "oneironaut.page.super_budding.4": "It seems to react to my gaze, as if endowed with some form of perception.",
  "oneironaut.page.super_budding.5": "The media generation rate of budding pseudoamethyst is such that even when immersed in thought slurry to inhibit crystal formation, it will still yield usable amounts of media. While the overall supply is nigh-endless, the amount accessible to any given action is quite small, like an inch-deep ocean a million miles across. However, due to this minimal depth, the media will dissipate rapidly before reaching my staff when accessed from afar, such as when recharging an item.",
  "oneironaut.page.super_budding.6": "Constantly provides about a tenth of an amethyst dust worth of media. While I $(o)can$() hold several of these in order to gain access to more media, this results in rapidly-diminishing returns. $(br)I should be careful not to craft with the wrong phial.",
  "oneironaut.page.super_budding.7": "I can also jam one into a trinket in order to replace its media supply with an inexhaustible phial, giving it access to the endless media within. However, it cannot use any media other than that provided by the phial.",
  "oneironaut.page.super_budding.8": "Writes a hex to the bottomless trinket in my other hand. Costs ten charged amethyst.",
  "oneironaut.page.idea_inscription.1": "As the noosphere is a realm of thought, it stands to reason that it could be used for information storage. These patterns do just that, inscribing an iota into the noosphere and reading it back (regardless of my current dimension). They can also store iotas inside the minds of other beings, assuming their thoughts are as... $(o)unfettered$() as my own. In the notation for these patterns, \"key\" refers to any vector or compatible entity.",
  "oneironaut.page.idea_inscription.2": "While this is quite versatile, the noosphere's ambient media is constantly in motion, and as such any iota stored in it will eventually be lost, similar to if I poured hot water into the ocean. It seems to take about an hour before such information decays into unusable garbage.$(br2)It seems that $(l:greatwork/akashiclib)Akashic Libraries$(/l) work based on similar principles, where the shelves serve as insulation to prevent decay.",
  "oneironaut.page.idea_inscription.3": "Accepts a valid key and any iota, and stores it in the corresponding location. Costs a quarter of an amethyst dust.",
  "oneironaut.page.idea_inscription.4": "Accepts a valid key, and returns the corresponding iota. Costs one-eigth of an amethyst dust.",

  "oneironaut.page.idea_inscription.6": "Accepts a valid key and a player, and returns whether the corresponding iota was inscribed by that player. Costs no media.",
  "oneironaut.page.sentinel_detection.1": "By combining the noosphere's pseudoamethyst with the organic sensory apparatus native to the deep dark, I've discovered a way to detect fluctuations in ambient media. This new form of sensor detects the presence of $(l:patterns/spells/sentinels)Sentinels$(/l) within approximately 16 meters, and outputs a redstone signal based on its proximity to the closest one. Comparators attached to it will output a signal if the sentinel in question is particularly powerful.",

  "oneironaut.page.sentinel_detection.3": "Additionally, this sensor can be incorporated into a Cleric Impetus, allowing it to activate when a sentinel is placed in the area (albeit with a lower range than the plain sensor). I've dubbed this contraption a Seer Impetus. Though it no longer responds to redstone, the circle's hex will start with a reference to the owner of the triggering sentinel on the stack.$(br)Due to the media interference produced by the cast, the impetus cannot detect sentinels it places itself.",
  "oneironaut.page.sentinel_detection.4": "As the sensor does not care whose sentinel it sees, I should take care to avoid allowing my trap circles to target me.",
  "oneironaut.page.sentinel_detection.5": "Accepts a vector and a player, and returns either the distance from the vector to the target player's sentinel or NULL. Costs a negligible amount of media.",
  "oneironaut.page.sentinel_detection.6": "Conjures a fleeting sensor at the target coordinates, which \"listens\" to the patterns in the ambient media to seek out the telltale signature of a sentinel.",
  "oneironaut.page.detection_shielding.1": "While conventional invisibility potions work just fine for fooling human senses, they are useless against hexes, so I've yet to find any method of making oneself completely undetectable. However, this spell I've discovered allows me to get closer to that goal, scattering media around a creature like chaff, in order to interfere with hex-based detection methods.",
  "oneironaut.page.detection_shielding.2": "Accepts a living entity and a number ($(o)n$()), and shields the entity from hex-based detection for $(o)n$() seconds. Costs two amethyst dust per second.",
  "oneironaut.page.detection_shielding.3": "Also drains media from the entity at a rate of 1/10 of a dust per second, as the shielding effect collects it to produce the chaff.$(br2)I should be careful with what I apply this to, as creatures with no loose media of their own will have their very minds fractured in order to provide this media.",
  "oneironaut.page.detection_shielding.4": "While this is very effective at blocking effects such as $(l:patterns/basics#hexcasting:raycast/entity)Scout's Distillation$(/l) and the various forms of $(l:patterns/entities#hexcasting:zone_entity/animal)Zone Distillation$(/l), it has no effect on $(l:patterns/entities#hexcasting:get_entity)Entity Purification$(/l) variants, as those already have a fairly precise idea of where you are. What's more, the chaff itself produces an energy signautre, which, while dim, is detectable by a specialized pattern.",
  "oneironaut.page.detection_shielding.5": "Accepts a vector and a number, and returns a list of unit vectors pointing from the initial vector to shrouded entities within a radius defined by the number.",
  "oneironaut.page.detection_shielding.6": "I've also discovered a spell which applies normal Invisibility. Functions just like the normal $(l:patterns/great_spells/zeniths)Zeniths$(/l), and costs one amethyst dust per three seconds.",
  "oneironaut.page.raycast_assailant.1": "By \"threading\" pseudoamethyst through a block, I can create something which causes any raycast (including entity raycasts) that hits or passes through it to return null, as if it didn't hit anything.",
  "oneironaut.page.raycast_assailant.3": "Strangely, combining pseudoamethyst with obsidian in the same way does not confer anti-raycast properties, instead making it nigh-indestructible to hexes. However, the resultant block loses much of its durability, being no stronger than common stone (though it retains its blast resistance).",
  "oneironaut.page.mindrender.1": "I've read legends of a particularly macabre form of weapon known as a Mind Render. This weapon, sometimes used by ancient hexcasters, is capable of severing a creature's very thoughts, dealing damage that bypasses all known forms of protection. What's more, if this damage leaves the target just on the brink of true death, it will fall into a vegetative state, never to recover. I shudder to think of what the ancients may have used this property for...",

  "oneironaut.page.lore.treatise1.1": "While it is possible to produce most iotas on the fly, there are cases where one finds it impractical, or simply cannot (such as very large and precise numbers, or entity references), and as such must obtain the desired iota in another way. Reading it from a Focus or a similar item works just fine, but in many cases this would require a third hand, which I do not have. Other methods of fetching iotas from external locations have their own limitations as well.",
  "oneironaut.page.lore.treatise1.2": "In cases where no external reference method would work well, one must insert the desired iota into the hex itself. This may seem counterintuive to some, what with the conventional wisdom being that a hex is a list of patterns, but one must remember that patterns are just another type of iota, which $(l:patterns/meta#hexcasting:eval)Hermes' Gambit$(/l) (and similar patterns) works particularly well with.",
  "oneironaut.page.lore.treatise1.3": "While you can't just shove a number into the list and expect it to be pushed to the stack as if it was a $(l:patterns/numbers)Numerical Reflection$(/l) pattern, there are ways around this.$(br2)The simplest (and least reliable) is the $(l:patterns/patterns_as_iotas#hexcasting:escape)Consideration$(/l) pattern. Similar to its use when casting freehand, anything that comes immediately after it in a list will be escaped and pushed to the stack when it might otherwise be executed, preventing mishaps due to execution of non-patterns.",
  "oneironaut.page.lore.treatise1.4": "However, when you're more than one exeuction deep in a hex (such as with nested conditional logic, or loops), the number of Considerations required to properly escape an iota increases exponentially, making it unreliable when used in anything that could conceivably be executed by another hex.",
  "oneironaut.page.lore.treatise1.4.link": "relevant xkcd",
  "oneironaut.page.lore.treatise1.5": "A far more reliable method of escaping iotas is to use $(l:patterns/patterns_as_iotas#hexcasting:open_paren)Introspection$(/l) and $(l:patterns/patterns_as_iotas#hexcasting:close_paren)Retrospection$(/l). When a pattern list is being evaluated and an Introspection is encountered, everything up to (but not including) its paired Retrospection is escaped and pushed to the stack in a list, regardless of iota type. You can then work with this list as you see fit, such as using $(l:patterns/lists#hexcasting:splat)Flock's Disintegration$(/l) to push all of its contents to the stack on their own.",

  "oneironaut.page.lore.treatise2.1": "When one wishes to impart motion upon something, the standard method is to use $(l:patterns/spells/basic#hexcasting:add_motion)Impulse$(/l). However, this can get prohibitively expensive when one wishes to make something move extremely quickly, as the cost increases exponentially with the length of the vector. This can be mitigated by simply using a magnitude-1 Impulse many times over on a single target, turning the overall cost from n^2 to 2n-1, where n is the magnitude of the vector.",
  "oneironaut.page.lore.treatise2.2": "The easiest way to accomplish this is with $(l:patterns/meta#hexcasting:for_each)Thoth's Gambit$(/l), by giving it a list containing many instances of the same entity reference.

  "oneironaut.page.lore.treatise3.1": "While $(l:patterns/meta#hexcasting:for_each)Thoth's Gambit$(/l) is perfectly-suited for casting something on many targets at once, using to it cast something on one target many times can get awkward, and short of completely halting the hex, it is not possible to add or remove targets once Thoth has begun executing.$(br)To get around these limitations, one simply needs to use a different sort of loop.",
  "oneironaut.page.lore.treatise3.2.header": "While Loop",
  "oneironaut.page.lore.treatise3.2": "A While loop is a loop that continues executing until some condition is fulfilled, such as an entity's target velocity having been reached. The most common way to accomplish this is creating a pattern list which duplicates and executes the top iota on the stack, duplicating it, then executing it. On its own this simply produces an infinite loop which does nothing but mishap.",
  "oneironaut.page.lore.treatise3.3": "However, by adding actual functionality and a bit of boolean logic, you can create a proper while loop. The code for the aforementioned infinite loop is as follows:$(br)Introspection$(br)Gemini Decomposition$(br)Hermes' Gambit$(br)Retrospection$(br)Gemini Decomposition$(br)Hermes' Gambit$(br2)By adding logic that changes whether the inner Hermes' Gambit gets evaluated based on a condition, you can make it stop once that condition is fulfilled.",

It also has the advantage that when done competently, it only ever produces one or two levels of recursion depth (not counting anything executed in the body of the loop). Loop unrolling is accomplished by creating a pattern list you want to repeat, duplicating it many times, and then combining all those lists into one.",
  "oneironaut.page.lore.treatise3.5": "The simplest way to accomplish this is to use $(l:patterns/stackmanip#hexcasting:duplicate)Gemini Decomposition$(/l) and then $(l:patterns/lists#hexcasting:add)Combination Distillation$(/l), resulting in a doubled pattern list. This method can be repeated to achieve greater powers of 2, and only produces a single level of recursion depth, when the list is executed. A more flexible method is to use $(l:patterns/stackmanip#hexcasting:duplicate_n)Gemini Gambit$(/l) to produce $(o)n$() copies of the list, then gathering $(o)n-1$() instances of the pattern for Combination Distillation into one list and executing it, thus merging all the copies of your original list into one.",

  "oneironaut.page.lore.science1.2": "The wisp-like phenomena that emerge from it are formed when the vast ambient media of the Noosphere attempts to rush through the hole (much like gas leaking into a near-vacuum) and gets tangled in a manner similar to how wisp-summoning spells weave the media which they consume.",
  "oneironaut.page.lore.science1.3": "Additionally, it seems that slipways have a sort of barrier over the entrance, preventing any matter from passing through. If this barrier could be pierced, and the hole expanded, the slipway would become capable of absorbing matter into the noosphere. It would also cease producing wisps, as the media coming through would do so far more slowly, and thus not be agitated and tangled. If one were to attempt this, they would have to be careful not to widen it too greatly, or they would risk the surrounding area being absorbed into the noosphere.",
