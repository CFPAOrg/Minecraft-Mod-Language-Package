totemic.entry.melody=Melody
totemic.page.melody0=§4Melody§0 is a magical power released from §4Instruments§0 that have been played. Each §1Instrument§0 has a §4Melody Threshold§0, meaning that only a certain amount §4Melody§0 can be released from one §4Instrument§0 for a specific effect.<br>Maybe in the future this §4Melody§0 will have functions with other things in the world.

totemic.entry.cedarTree=The Red Cedar tree
totemic.page.cedarTree0=The §1Red Cedar Tree§0 is a tree that naturally has capabilities for Totemic purposes. It can be obtained by infusing mundane saplings with musical energy in the §4Rite of Spring Ceremony§0. §1Red Cedar Wood§0 has the same properties and crafting applications as standard wood. In addition, a §4Bark Stripper§0 is able to remove its bark to make more efficient uses of its resources.
totemic.page.cedarTree1=Finally, it can be used to craft certain instruments like the §1Wind Chimes§0 or §1Jingle Dress§0.

totemic.entry.buffaloBasic=Buffaloes
totemic.page.buffaloBasic0=The mighty Buffalo, an animal which is known across the lands for all of the resources it can grant. They are incredibly sturdy and have a very large amount of health. Hunting has left them nearly extinct, but they can still be 'created' with the §4Buffalo Dance Ceremony§0.

totemic.entry.creatingTotems=§oTotem Poles
totemic.page.creatingTotems0=Creating a §4Totem Pole§0 is a very simple thing to do. First you must create a §1Totem Whittling Knife§0, which is the tool used to carve out a §4Totem Pole§0 out of any kind of wood logs. The knife can carve different patterns of §4Totem Poles§0, which will lead to different effects. Right clicking or scrolling while sneaking will change which pattern will be carved.
totemic.page.creatingTotems1=A Totem Whittling Knife is also needed to carve out the §1Totem Base§0. Each Totem Pole needs one Totem Base at the bottom of the pole, and can can extend 6 meters high.<br>Totem Poles will by default give beneficial §4effects§0 to all nearby players. The effects depend on the carving pattern. A Totem Pole can have different carvings on different heights.

totemic.entry.totemEffects=Totem Effects
totemic.page.totemEffects0=These are the different effects you can carve on a Totem pole:<br>§1Bat§0: Negates fall damage and lets you jump further when you sneak mid-air<br>§1Blaze§0: Gives you Fire Resistance<br>§1Buffalo§0: Makes you mine faster
totemic.page.totemEffects1=§1Cow§0: Gives you resistance to damage, but also slows you down<br>§1Enderman§0: Gives you night vision<br>§1Horse§0: Gives you a speed boost<br>§1Ocelot§0: Prevents Creepers from exploding<br>§1Pig§0: Brings you good luck
totemic.page.totemEffects2=§1Rabbit§0: Gives you a jump boost<br>§1Spider§0: Lets you climb walls like a spider<br>§1Squid§0: Gives you Water Breathing<br>§1Wolf§0: Gives you strength

totemic.entry.medicineBag=Medicine Bag
totemic.page.medicineBag0=The §1Medicine Bag§0 allows you to carry a §4Totem Effect§0 with you, so you can use its benefits for a limited time without having to be near a Totem Pole.<br>Once you have crafted your Medicine Bag, Sneak+Right click it on a Totem Pole block carved with the effect you want to have. Then you can right click the bag to open it and release its effect, or to close it.
totemic.page.medicineBag1=The Medicine Bag will last for a few minutes before it depletes. To charge it, just stand near a §1Totem Pole§0 that has your bag's effect carved into it.

totemic.entry.instruments=§oInstruments
totemic.page.instruments0=Instruments are a way to create §4Melody§0, the life of §1Totem Poles§0. When an instrument is played, their melody will seep into a nearby §1Totem Poles§0. Every instrument produces §4Melody§0 in different ways. Along that, each instrument has a different amount of §4Melody§0 that a §4Ceremonies§0 may be able to accept, meaning that many different §4Instruments§0 are needed for effective use.

totemic.entry.windChime=Wind Chime
totemic.page.windChime0=The §1Wind Chime§0 is an instrument that will wave in the wind and periodically produce §4Melody§0. The §1Wind Chime§0 cannot have any blocks below it, and must be hanging from a block above it. While the §1Wind Chime§0 does not create a large amount of §4Melody§0, it does not require any intervention by players. It is recommended that only a couple of Wind Chimes hang near a §1Totem Pole§0 at once.
totemic.page.windChime1=It is not rare to see §1Wind Chimes§0 hanging from the branches of leaves, there have even been rumors that it could make them create more §4Melody§0. When the §1Wind Chime§0 is playing, it will shake vigorously and create §1Melody§0. Because the music from the §1Wind Chime§0 is so easy to come by, the §4Melody Threshold§0 is easily reached. Hitting a §1Wind Chime§0 whilst §4Sneaking§0 will make it play in §4Selector Mode§0.

totemic.entry.drum=Drum
totemic.page.drum0=The §1Drum§0 is an instrumental block that can be played by simply bashing it with either fist. All §1Totemists§0 should learn the rhythm which is used when a §1Flute§0 and a §1Drum§0 are being played together, as it may be required for early §1Ceremonies§0.
totemic.page.drum1=It is recommended to have a few §1Drums§0 around a §1Totem Pole§0 in order to be able alternatively play them. As with most instruments, §4sneaking§0 when playing it will allow you to select a §4Ceremony§0.

totemic.entry.jingleDress=Jingle Dress
totemic.page.jingleDress0=The §1Jingle Dress§0. One of the most prestigious pieces of clothing available for any §4Totemists§0. It is a leaf dress adorned with bells. Running will create §4Melody§0, they say the faster you run the more it creates, and a speed potion increases it even further! Perhaps its effect could be activated by running in between §1Drum§0 beats.
totemic.page.jingleDress1=Because the effect of this §1Instrument§0 is fairly passive, it does not create much §4Melody§0, and its §4Melody Threshold§0 is easily reached. Interestingly enough, it seems like the §4Jingle Dress§0 is one of the few §4Instruments§0 that cannot be used as a §4Ceremony Selector§0.

totemic.entry.flute=Flute
totemic.page.flute0=Sometimes a §1Flute§0 can be one of the most simple and effective instruments available. Unlike other instruments, the §1Flute§0 simply plays music without any complication. Because of its simplicity, it is not known to be the most melodic instrument, meaning it will not create much §4Melody§0, and its §4Melody Threshold§0 will be reached easily. When §4sneaking§0, it can be used to select a §4Ceremony§0 for any nearby §4Totem Poles§0.
totemic.page.flute1=The §1Flute§0 can be infused in the §4Serenade for Syrinx§0, giving it special properties.

totemic.entry.rattle=Rattle
totemic.page.rattle0=The §1Ceremonial Rattle§0 is an §4Instrument§0 which is a backbone of any more advanced §4Ceremonies§0. The §1Rattle§0 produces §4Melody§0 whenever it has been shook with the hand.<br>It can be used in dual wield: if you hold the Rattle in your right hand, you can have another instrument in your left hand and play both at the same time.
totemic.page.rattle1=Like all §4Instruments§0, it can be played while §4sneaking§0 so as to activate §4Ceremonies§0.

totemic.entry.eagleBoneWhistle=Eagle-Bone Whistle
totemic.page.eagleBoneWhistle0=The §1Eagle-Bone Whistle§0 is made from the bones of a §4Bald Eagle§0, and as such it is very powerful. It is a necessity for more advanced §4Ceremonies§0, and is actually considered more of a ceremonial object than an §4Instrument§0.

totemic.entry.netherPipe=Netherumbrian Pipes
totemic.page.netherPipe0=The §1Netherumbrian Pipes§0 are one of the most curious instruments of them all. Although a truly vile creation, it has many uses for a Totemist. Charging it up like you would a bow makes its bellows draw in air, and after releasing all of its fumes, the §1Netherumbrian Pipes§0 will drain the life of all nearby crops. After draining their life, it will release a large amount of §4Melody§0. What's interesting about these set of is that they will give
totemic.page.netherPipe1=off their maximum amount of music within a few plays. Do not take that lightly however, as each play creates several times more music than any other instrument. After crafting, an activation is required. To do this, simply take damage from wither effects with the §1Netherumbrian Pipes§0 in hand. Interestingly enough, it seems to prefer the life essence of Nether Wart.
totemic.page.netherPipe2=        Soft and sweet

totemic.entry.basicsCeremonies=§oBasics of Ceremonies
totemic.page.basicsCeremonies0=§4Ceremonies§0 are a way for a Totemist to gather strength over a period of time through the power of §4Melody§0 to release a central burst of energy on both players and the nearby world. The center of a Ceremony is a §1Totem Base§0 and it also is where the effects of a Ceremony are released from. Ceremonies are powered by the §4Melody§0 that is released from §4Instruments§0 when they are played.
totemic.page.basicsCeremonies1=There are two main points in a Ceremony, the first being §4Selection§0, and the second being the §4Ceremony Effects§0.

totemic.entry.selectingCeremonies=§oSelecting Ceremonies
totemic.page.selectingCeremonies0=In order to select which §4Ceremony§0 you wish to activate, a specific task must be complete. Any §4Instruments§0 played whilst §4Sneaking§0 will play in their §4Selector Mode§0, and will not release any §4Melody§0 as they would normally. A combination of two §4Instruments§0 in §4Selector Mode§0 will start a Ceremony depending on which were played. For example, using the §1Flute§0 in selector mode twice will activate the §4Serenade of the Depths§0.

totemic.entry.performingCeremonies=§oPerforming Ceremonies
totemic.page.performingCeremonies0=Once a §4Ceremony§0 has been selected, the §4startup§0 will initiate. While it is in this stage, the §1Totem Pole§0 will accept any played §1Melody§0 and store it. In order for a Ceremony effect to activate, a certain amount of §4Melody§0 is required depending on how difficult the Ceremony is. This difficulty is represented by how many ♪ there are in its entry in this book. When the §4Melody Requirement§0 for the Ceremony is reached, it will activate.
totemic.page.performingCeremonies1=Each §4Instrument§0 can only be played up to a certain point, meaning a Ceremony could not be played with just one §4Instrument§0. This is known as the §4Melody Threshold§0. Any smoke that emits from the §1Totem Base§0 will signify that the most recently played §4Instrument§0 has reached its §4Melody Threshold§0 for that Ceremony, and the user should stop using that specific §4Instrument§0 for the rest of the Ceremony.
totemic.page.performingCeremonies2=Additionally, there is a limited amount of time to complete a Ceremony, meaning playing speed is important. After you have created enough §4Melody§0, the Ceremony will begin performing its effects. Some Ceremonies have instant effects, others will last over a certain amount of time after the effect initially starts. It should be noted that the effects can only pertain for a certain amount of time, and will stop after that time has elapsed.
totemic.page.performingCeremonies3=Finally, there should be care taken with the timing between playing §4Instruments§0, in order to complete a Ceremony efficiently, a rhythm between instruments may be important. Because of that, it is recommended that a §4Totemist§0 spends some time getting used to the rhythms of certain §4Instruments§0.

totemic.entry.ceremonyTips=§oTips for Ceremonies
totemic.page.ceremonyTips0=• After you selected a Ceremony, you need to §4stop sneaking§0 so that your music counts for the Ceremony.<br>• If you see white smoke coming from the Totem Pole after playing an instrument, its §4Melody Threshold§0 is reached and you should stop playing it.<br>• §4Wind Chimes§0 play at somewhat regular intervals. Try to time your Ceremony around them.
totemic.page.ceremonyTips1=• More Instruments of the same kind usually don't help that much. Try getting more §4unique Instruments§0 if you can.<br>• That said, it can be helpful to have two §4Drums§0 and two or three §4Wind Chimes§0.<br>• Try holding your Flute in the §4left hand§0 and your Rattle in the §4right hand§0 to play both at once.
totemic.page.ceremonyTips2=• If you want to cancel a Ceremony, e.g. when you made a wrong selection, you can §4left-click§0 your Totemic Staff on the Totem Base.<br>• The time you have available to complete a Ceremony changes with §4game difficulty§0.

totemic.entry.warDance=War Dance
totemic.page.warDance0=The §4War Dance Ceremony§0 is a Ceremony that will heighten your senses for an incoming war and bring the adrenalin to your entire body. After performing it, the §4Ceremony§0 will bring the user Speed and Strength for a long period of time time, allowing them to rush to battle.
totemic.page.warDance1=§oA convoluted game of chess§r

totemic.entry.depths=Symphony of the Depths
totemic.page.depths0=The §4Symphony of the Depths§0, along with the §4War Dance§0 are some of the most basic and mundane §4Ceremonies§0 of all. The effect of this §4Ceremony§0 is as simple as it is to perform, any nearby players will be blessed with a §4Water Breathing§0 effect for a few minutes.
totemic.page.depths1=§oMoon River§r

totemic.entry.fertility=Rite of Spring
totemic.page.fertility0=The §4Rite of Spring§0 is the one of the many growth and fertility §4Ceremonies§0 available to a Totemist. After activating, all nearby animals and villagers will sequentially proceed to breed, consuming food items or Emeralds respectively. However there is a decent chance that a food item will not be consumed.<br>Along with that, any nearby saplings will transform into §1Red Cedar Saplings§0.
totemic.page.fertility1=§oLover I don't have to love§r

totemic.entry.zaphkielWaltz=Zaphkiel Waltz
totemic.page.zaphkielWaltz0=The §4Zaphkiel Waltz§0 is a growth and fertility §4Ceremony§0 that affects nearby crops. For a short while, nearby plants will grow at a much faster rate than usual. In addition, any nearby §1Eggs§0 will have a chance to hatch into living §4Chickens§0 at a much higher rate than they would if they were thrown.
totemic.page.zaphkielWaltz1=§oGothicly elegant§r

totemic.entry.buffaloDance=Buffalo Dance
totemic.page.buffaloDance0=This beast used to roam the lands in large herds, but was mysteriously wiped out long before you came into this world. However, not all hope is lost. The §4Buffalo Dance§0 Ceremony is able to give strength to nearby Cows and turn them into Buffalos. They will start out as infants and only gain their full strength after a while.
totemic.page.buffaloDance1=§oAvoid using red rags§r

totemic.entry.rainDance=Rain Dance Ceremony
totemic.page.rainDance0=The §4Rain Dance Ceremony§0 is a way for you to bring a torrent of rain into the world. If the rain becomes too much to bare, the §4Drought Ceremony§0 is always available, which will remove all rain. Because the effects of this §4Ceremony§0 are so potent, it may be hard to perform.
totemic.page.rainDance1=§oLike a Politoed§r.

totemic.entry.drought=Drought Ceremony
totemic.page.drought0=The §4Drought Ceremony§0 will clear the sky and end any storms that may be plaguing your world. It is simply the opposite of the §4Rain Dance Ceremony§0.
totemic.page.drought1=§oNinetails, Not Kurama!§r

totemic.entry.fluteInfusion=Serenade for Syrinx
totemic.page.fluteInfusion0=The §4Serenade for Syrinx§0 is a way to enchant a regular §1Flute§0 with melodic energy, giving it special properties. Nearby flutes in your inventory or on the ground will be infused with Totemic energy, becoming §1Pan's Flute§0. The timbre of her Flute is quite more beautiful than that of a mundane one, meaning it produces more §4Melody§0 and works better with §4Totem Poles§0.
totemic.page.fluteInfusion1=In addition, nearby §1Animals§0 and §1Villagers§0 will be completely and utterly unable to resist the melody, and will follow you if you play the flute.
totemic.page.fluteInfusion2=§oHide in the Sugar Cane§r

totemic.entry.eagleDance=Eagle Dance
totemic.page.eagleDance0=The §1Bald Eagle§0 is a sacred bird, some say they are spiritual messengers between humans and gods. Its feathers and bones are important ceremonial items and are used to make the §1Eagle-Bone Whistle§0.<br>Since they have gone almost extinct, they are not found in the wild; similarly to Buffalos they have to be created by the §4Eagle Dance§0 Ceremony. This Ceremony will infuse
totemic.page.eagleDance1=nearby §1Parrots§0 and turn them into Bald Eagles. Once transformed, they can be tamed with any kind of raw fish and bred with Salmon.
totemic.page.eagleDance2=§oWelcome to 'Murica!§r

totemic.entry.cleansing=Steve's Lullaby
totemic.page.cleansing0=§4Steve's Lullaby§0 is such a beautiful and cleansing piece that it is able to calm down, and remove the evil properties of a few select monsters in the world. §4Zombie Villagers§0 will become their living counterpart. The same will occur for §4Zombie Pigmen§0, becoming regular §4Pigs§0. Only a few monsters will be affected per activation, and they need to have been §4weakened§0 by a potion effect first.

totemic.entry.danseMacabre=Danse Macabre
totemic.page.danseMacabre0=The §4Danse Macabre§0 is probably the most deceptive §4Ceremony§0 of them all. All nearby §1Rotten Flesh§0 on the ground will transform into very, very dangerous §4Zombies§0. Whilst this may seem like a downside, there is a decent chance that the creation will instead be a §4Zombie Villagers§0. Interestingly enough, if performed in the §1Nether§0 it seems like a different monster will spawn in the world instead.
totemic.page.danseMacabre1=These effects effectively mean that §1Rotten Flesh§0 can be converted into §4Experience Points§0, or if it is combined with §4Steve's Lullaby§0, it will be able to create §4Villagers§0.
