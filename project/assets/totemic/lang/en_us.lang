totemic.entry.cedarTree=The Red Cedar tree
totemic.page.cedarTree0=The §1Red Cedar Tree§0 is a large tree that has magical properties, so its wood is especially useful for carving Totem poles out of. It can be obtained by infusing mundane saplings with musical energy in the §4Zaphkiel Waltz ceremony§0.
totemic.page.cedarTree1=Red Cedar wood has the same properties and crafting applications as standard wood. In addition, a §4Bark Stripper§0 is able to remove its bark to make more efficient uses of its resources.

totemic.entry.buffaloBasic=Buffaloes
totemic.page.buffaloBasic0=The mighty Buffalo, an animal which is known across the lands for all of the resources it can grant. They are incredibly sturdy and have a very large amount of health. Hunting has left them nearly extinct, but they can still be 'created' with the §4Mandan Buffalo Dance§0 Ceremony. 
totemic.page.buffaloBasic1=

totemic.entry.creatingTotems=§oTotem Poles
totemic.page.creatingTotems0=Creating a §4Totem Pole§0 is a very simple thing to do. First you must create a §1Totem Whittling Knife§0, which is the tool used to carve out a §4Totem Pole§0 out of any kind of wood logs. The knife can carve different patterns of §4Totem Poles§0, which will lead to different effects. Right clicking or scrolling while sneaking will change which pattern will be carved.
totemic.page.creatingTotems1=A Totem Whittling Knife is also needed to carve out the §1Totem Base§0. Each Totem Pole needs one Totem Base at the bottom of the pole, and can can extend 6 meters high.<br>Totem Poles will by default give beneficial §4effects§0 to all nearby players. The effects depend on the carving pattern. A Totem Pole can have different carvings on different heights.
totemic.page.creatingTotems2=

totemic.entry.totemEffects=Totem Effects
totemic.page.totemEffects0=These are the different effects you can carve on a Totem pole:<br>§1Bat§0: Negates fall damage and lets you jump further when you sneak mid-air<br>§1Blaze§0: Gives you Fire Resistance<br>§1Buffalo§0: Makes you mine faster
totemic.page.totemEffects1=§1Cow§0: Gives you resistance to damage, but also slows you down<br>§1Enderman§0: Gives you night vision<br>§1Horse§0: Gives you a speed boost<br>§1Ocelot§0: Prevents Creepers from exploding<br>§1Pig§0: Brings you good luck
totemic.page.totemEffects2=§1Rabbit§0: Gives you a jump boost<br>§1Spider§0: Lets you climb walls like a spider<br>§1Squid§0: Gives you Water Breathing<br>§1Wolf§0: Gives you strength

totemic.entry.medicineBag=Medicine Bag
totemic.page.medicineBag0=The §1Medicine Bag§0 allows you to carry a §4Totem effect§0 with you, so you can use its benefits for a limited time without having to be near a Totem Pole.<br>Once you have crafted your Medicine Bag, Sneak+Right click it on a Totem Pole block carved with the effect you want to have. Then you can right click the bag to open it and release its effect, or to close it.
totemic.page.medicineBag1=The Medicine Bag will last for a few minutes before it depletes. To charge it, just stand near a Totem Pole that has your bag's effect carved into it.
totemic.page.medicineBag2=

totemic.entry.instruments=§oInstruments
totemic.page.instruments0=Instruments are a way to create §4Musical Melody§0, the life of §1Totem Poles§0. When an instrument is played, their melody will seep into a nearby §1Totem Poles§0. Every instrument produces §4Musical Melody§0 in different ways. Along that, each instrument has a different amount of §4Musical Melody§0 that a §4Ceremonies§0 may be able to accept, meaning that many different instruments are needed for effective use. 

totemic.entry.windChime=Wind Chime
totemic.page.windChime0=The §1Wind Chime§0 is an instrument that will wave in the wind and periodically produce §4Musical Melody§0. The §1Wind Chime§0 cannot have any blocks below it, and must be hanging from a block above it. While the §1Wind Chime§0 does not create a large amount of §4Musical Melody§0, it does not require any intervention by players.
totemic.page.windChime1=It is not rare to see §1Wind Chimes§0 hanging from the branches of leaves, there have even been rumours that it could make them create more §4Musical Melody§0. When the §1Wind Chime§0 is playing, it will shake vigorously and create music. Because the music from the §1Wind Chime§0 is so easy to come by, it does not take much of it before the maximum amount of §4Musical Melody§0 is reached.
totemic.page.windChime2=

totemic.entry.drum=Drum
totemic.page.drum0=The §1Drum§0 is an instrumental block that can be played by simply bashing it with either fist. Because playing the instrument is so tiring, it can take a second before you will be able to play it again. Drum beats are usually constant, and a vital part of any Ceremony. Because of that the music is quite melodic. As with most instruments, §4sneaking§0 when playing it will allow you to select a §4Ceremony§0.
totemic.page.drum1=

totemic.entry.jingleDress=Jingle Dress
totemic.page.jingleDress0=The §1Jingle Dress§0. One of the most prestigious pieces of clothing available for any §4Totemists§0. It is a leaf Dress adorned with bells. Running around will cause it to play music to all nearby Totem Poles. They say the faster you run the more music it creates, and a speed potion increases it even further!
totemic.page.jingleDress1=The sound of this instrument is highly melodic, meaning that it produces a large amount if played correctly, and §1Totems§0 can also accept a high amount of the §4Musical Melody§0 from it.
totemic.page.jingleDress2=
totemic.page.jingleDress3=

totemic.entry.flute=Flute
totemic.page.flute0=Sometimes a §1Flute§0 can be one of the most simple and effective instruments available. Unlike other instruments, the §1Flute§0 simply plays music without any complication. Because of its simplicity, it is not known to be the most melodic instrument, meaning that §4Totems§0 may not accept very much of the melody. When §4sneaking§0, it can be used to select a §4Ceremony§0 for any nearby §4Totem Poles§0.
totemic.page.flute1=The §1Flute§0 can be infused in the §4Ceremony of Flute Imbuation§0, giving it special properties.
totemic.page.flute2=

totemic.entry.rattle=Rattle
totemic.page.rattle0=The §1Ceremonial Rattle§0 is a instrument which has been a backbone of Ceremonies for as long as Totemists have been known. The §1Rattle§0 produces §4Musical Melody§0 whenever it has been shook with the hand.<br>It can be used in dual wield: if you hold the Rattle in your right hand, you can have another instrument in your left hand and play both at the same time.
totemic.page.rattle1=Like all instruments, it can be played while §4sneaking§0 so as to activate ceremonies.
totemic.page.rattle2=

totemic.entry.eagleBoneWhistle=Eagle-Bone Whistle
totemic.page.eagleBoneWhistle0=The §1Eagle-Bone Whistle§0 is made from the bones of a §4Bald Eagle§0, and as such it is very powerful. It is a necessity for more advanced Ceremonies, and actually considered more of a ceremonial object than a music instrument. 
totemic.page.eagleBoneWhistle1=

totemic.entry.performingCeremonies=§oPerforming Ceremonies
totemic.page.performingCeremonies0=§4Ceremonies§0 are a way for a Totemist to gather strength over a period of time through the power of §4Musical Melody§0, and other acts to release as a central burst of effects on both players, and the nearby world. The center of a §4Ceremony§0 is a §1Totem Base§0, all music and other influences are channeled to the §1Totem Pole§0 and it is where the effects are released from.
totemic.page.performingCeremonies1=To perform a §4Ceremony§0, there are a few things you must do. To select and initiate your §4Ceremony§0, you must play 2 Instruments in their selector mode whilst next to a §1Totem Pole§0. Depending in which Instruments are played, a different §4Ceremony§0 will activate. To play an Instrument in selector mode, just play it normally whilst §4sneaking§0. When you have played the corresponding instruments for a §4Ceremony§0,
totemic.page.performingCeremonies2=the §4startup§0 will initiate. While it is in this startup mode, the §1Totem Pole§0 will accept all nearby music and store it. This is §4Musical Melody§0, and it is what is needed for the §4Ceremonies§0 effect to activate. When the total §4Musical Melody§0 hits the threshold of the §4Ceremonies§0 Melody requirement, it will activate the effect. Each instrument can only be played up to a certain point,
totemic.page.performingCeremonies3=meaning a whole ceremony could not be played with just one instrument. As much variety as possible is required to complete a ceremony. Additionally, there is a limited amount of time to complete a §4Ceremony§0, meaning playing speed is important. After you created enough §4Musical Melody§0, the §4Ceremony§0 will begin performing its effects. Some §4Ceremonies§0 have instant effects, others will last over a certain amount
totemic.page.performingCeremonies4=of time after the effect initially starts. Doing the effects will drain the §4Musical Melody§0 over that time. It should be noted that the effects can only go for a certain amount of time and will stop after that time has elapsed.

totemic.entry.rainDance=Rain Dance Ceremony
totemic.page.rainDance0=The §4Rain Dance Ceremony§0 is a way for you to bring a torrent of rain into the world. If the rain becomes too much to bare, the §4Drought Ceremony§0 is always available, which will remove all rain. Because the effects of this §4Ceremony§0 are so potent, it may be hard to perform.
totemic.page.rainDance1=§oLike a Politoed§r.

totemic.entry.drought=Drought Ceremony
totemic.page.drought0=The §4Drought Ceremony§0 will clear the sky and end any storms that may be plaguing your world. It is simply the opposite of the §4Rain Dance Ceremony§0.
totemic.page.drought1=§oNinetails, Not Kurama!§r

totemic.entry.warDance=War Dance
totemic.page.warDance0=The §4War Dance Ceremony§0 is a Ceremony that will heighten your senses for an incoming war and bring the adrenalin to your entire body. After performing it, the §4Ceremony§0 will bring the user Speed and Strength for a long time, allowing them to rush to battle.
totemic.page.warDance1=§oA convoluted game of chess§r

totemic.entry.buffaloDance=Mandan Buffalo Dance
totemic.page.buffaloDance0=As the White Man came and took over the lands, he murdered almost all of the §1Buffalos§0 that were once roaming the lands in large hordes. However, not all hope is lost. The §4Mandan Buffalo Dance§0 Ceremony is able to give strength to nearby Cows and turn them into Buffalos, although a weaker kind than those that were once native. But they will grow larger and stronger over time.
totemic.page.buffaloDance1=§oAvoid using red rags§r

totemic.entry.eagleDance=Eagle Dance
totemic.page.eagleDance0=The §1Bald Eagle§0 is a sacred bird, some say they are spiritual messengers between humans and gods. Its feathers and bones are important ceremonial items and are used to make the §1Eagle-Bone Whistle§0.<br>Since they have gone almost extinct, they are not found in the wild; similarly to Buffalos they have to be created by the §4Eagle Dance§0 Ceremony. This Ceremony will infuse
totemic.page.eagleDance1=nearby §1Parrots§0 and turn them into Bald Eagles. Once transformed, they can be tamed with any kind of raw fish and bred with Salmon.
totemic.page.eagleDance2=§oWelcome to 'Murica!§r

totemic.entry.zaphkielWaltz=Zaphkiel Waltz
totemic.page.zaphkielWaltz0=The §4Zaphkiel Waltz§0 is a growth and fertility §4Ceremony§0 for nearby crops. For a short while, nearby plants will grow at a much faster rate than usual. In addition, chickens will hatch out of nearby eggs. Finally, the Zaphkiel Waltz will also transform all nearby mundane saplings into §4Red Cedar Saplings§0.
totemic.page.zaphkielWaltz1=§oGothicly elegant§r

totemic.entry.fluteInfusion=Flute Imbuation
totemic.page.fluteInfusion0=The §4Ceremony of Flute Imbuation§0 is a way to enchant a regular §1Flute§0 with melodic energy, giving it special properties. Nearby flutes in your inventory or on the ground will be infused with Totemic energy.<br>The timbre of this §1Infused Flute§0 is quite more melodic than a mundane Flute. This means that §1Animals§0 and §1Villagers§0 cannot resist it and will follow you.
totemic.page.fluteInfusion1=Its effects on Totems is more potent as well.
totemic.page.fluteInfusion2=§oStronger than Twilicane§r

totemic.entry.baykokSummon=Chimes of Death
totemic.page.baykokSummon0=The §4Chimes of Death§0 is a Ceremony that will summon the spirit known as §4Baykok§0. Do not attempt this ceremony unless you are well equiped for combat.<br>§4Baykok§0 is an evil spirit who appears as a skeleton-like figure. He ruthlessly hunts warriors and is a master of archery, attacking with invisible arrows. He paralyzes his prey and devours their livers. 
totemic.page.baykokSummon1=If you manage to defeat §4Baykok§0, you will be able to get his bow, among other loots. With §1Baykok's Bow§0 you will also be able to fire invisible and paralyzing arrows (they will only be visible to you). His bow is stronger and more easily enchantable than a mundane bow.
totemic.page.baykokSummon2=§oyou're gonna have a bad time§r

totemic.entry.sunDance=Sun Dance
totemic.page.sunDance0=The §4Sun Dance§0 is one of the most sacred Ceremonies, and also the most painful one to perform: You will be faced with a §1near-death experience§0. If you pull through, you and everyone nearby will be healed and protected from damage for a while.<br>The Sun Dance will not reduce your health below half a heart.
totemic.page.sunDance1=§oKneeling, my god is the sun§r

totemic.entry.totemicStaff=Totemic Staff
totemic.page.totemicStaff0=The §1Totemic Staff§0 can be used to gather information on several blocks by right clicking on them.<br>In addition, holding one whilst left-clicking a Totem Base will cancel ceremonies, and any musical selections on it.
totemic.page.totemicStaff1=§oNo resemblance to wrenches§r

totemic.entry.barkStripper=Bark Stripper
totemic.page.barkStripper0=The §1Bark Stripper§0 is a way for you to remove the bark from your §1Red Cedar Logs§0 and reveal stripped wood from the tree. To do so, just hold the §1Bark Stripper§0 in your hand, and right click on the log, after a few seconds it will finish stripping the bark from the log, revealing the stripped log.
totemic.page.barkStripper1=The §1Red Cedar Stripped Log§0 can be crafted into planks at a more efficient rate, and can be put in a furnace to create charcoal.<br>Red Cedar Stripped Logs that are left on grass will slowly regrow their bark after a while.
totemic.page.barkStripper2=

#TODO
#totemic.page.barkStripper0=The §1Bark Stripper§0 is a way for you to collect the bark from your §1Red Cedar Logs§0 and reveal stripped wood from the tree. To do so, just hold the §1Bark Stripper§0 in your hand, and right click on the log, after a few seconds it will finish stripping the bark from the log, revealing the stripped log and creating the bark.
#totemic.page.barkStripper1=There are many uses for both the bark and the stripped log. The §1Red Cedar Stripped Log§0 can be crafted into planks at a more efficient rate, and can be put in a furnace to create charcoal, while the bark is a crafting component for some blocks and items, usually to reinforce items.

totemic.entry.baykokBow=Baykok's Bow
totemic.page.baykokBow0=§4Baykok's Bow§0 is a powerful bow that can only be obtained by slaying the spirit §4Baykok§0. Baykok can be summoned with the §4Chimes of Death§0 Ceremony.<br>Arrows fired from this bow deal more damage, and non-tipped arrows will become invisible to anyone but you. The bow is also more easily enchantable and more durable than a mundane bow.

totemic.entry.tipi=Tipi
totemic.page.tipi0=The §1Tipi§0 is cone shaped tent which can be used to sleep through the night. It consists of a wooden frame, adorned with a tarp consisting of either Buffalo hide or textile. It can be placed ontop of a flat surface of grass or dirt, and requires an open sky to be used.
