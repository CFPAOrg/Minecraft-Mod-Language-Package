embers.research.page.sulfur=Sulfur
embers.research.page.sulfur.title=Corrosive Vents
embers.research.page.sulfur.desc=The caves are not only filled with mineral riches and foul fiends. Sometimes you might come across a curious orifice of earth and stone. When disturbed, this vent exhales a cloud of brimstone that forms a corrosive substance in contact with the damp cavern air. The huge chunk of sulfur obtained from harvesting them is yet unsuitable for further manufacture and needs to be crushed into dust in a Stamper first.

embers.research.page.redstone_bin=Trapdoor Bin
embers.research.page.redstone_bin.title=Controlled Drops
embers.research.page.redstone_bin.desc=Sometimes one might want to drop a whole batch of junk at once. The Trapdoor Bin works exactly as its regular counterpart, but when a redstone signal is applied, the bottom opens up and all of its contents fall out immediately.

embers.research.page.insulation=Insulation
embers.research.page.insulation.title=Heat Conservation
embers.research.page.insulation.desc=The Hearth Coil is a spectacular machine. And just as spectacular is its Ember consumption to stay lit. These new Insulation upgrades may just help that a little. Each Insulation upgrade increases the maximum heat of the coil significantly and additionally reduces the cooling speed by 30%%. With some redstone design you may be able to significantly increase the efficiency of the coil this way...

embers.research.page.scale=Scales
embers.research.page.scale.title=Measuring Cups
embers.research.page.scale.desc=Alchemy is a very menial and thankless work. Ash needs to be precisely measured or your valuable components will just be incinerated. Hopefully this device can help with doing just that. When attaching two containers to the top half of the Scales, the bottom half will emit a redstone signal in the direction counter-clockwise to the heavier container, or both sides if they are equal.

embers.research.page.advanced_emitters=Advanced Ember Transfer
embers.research.page.advanced_emitters.title=One-to-Many and Many-to-One
embers.research.page.advanced_emitters.desc=The Ember Spread Burst can emit Ember in up to 5 different directions that can be linked to different machinery. Simply hook each side up as you would a regular emitter and enable it with a redstone signal.

embers.research.page.eitr=Eitr
embers.research.page.eitr.title=Miyazaki Why
embers.research.page.eitr.desc=By investigating the sulfur you've discovered in the Caverns, you've devised the perfect union of everybody's favorite mechanics. Eitr is a wretched hunk of metal infused with alchemical substances that corrode anything it touches. It's very weak, even weaker than its mirror image, the ashen Tyrfing. But when striking an enemy, half the damage will be converted into pure durability damage to the opponents armor.

embers.research.page.alchemy_globe=Alchemical Recombulator
embers.research.page.alchemy_globe.title=I.O.U
embers.research.page.alchemy_globe.desc=I owe you one documentation of the Alchemical Recombulator.

embers.research.page.mundane_stone=Mundane Stone
embers.research.page.mundane_stone.title=Legends Never Die
embers.research.page.mundane_stone.desc=Not all tools were created equal. Some tools weren't meant to be used as weapons. But you don't really care, because you've found that pounding this stone into your tools makes them deal about as much damage as an equivalent tool that was meant to be a weapon. Applying this augment doesn't even require an augment slot. You almost feel dirty using this cheap trick...

embers.research.page.witch_fire=Beltaine Brazier
embers.research.page.witch_fire.title=Town Of Salem
embers.research.page.witch_fire.desc=Witches are powerful adversaries. They pack a sheer unlimited amount of potions and to top it off they're nearly immune to magical damage, which makes magical weaponry rather unsuitable. To remedy this, you've come up with a new augment: The Beltaine Brazier will give Ember projectiles a special burning effect that deals damage like ordinary fire but also prevents witches (and other creatures) from healing.

embers.research.brewing=Brewing

embers.research.page.still=Brewing Still
embers.research.page.still.title=Honorary Dwarven Brewer
embers.research.page.still.desc=The Brewing Still is a large dawnstone vessel that brews and refines alcohol. The process is a bit involved and functions as follows: A melter should be used to obtain the base of your brew. The base should be pumped into the bottom of the large vessel. The tap can have an item added via some kind of item piping or a hopper, which will affect the brew in certain ways. The distilled fluid will finally exit into a vessel below the tap.

embers.research.page.still_fuel=Heating the Still
embers.research.page.still_fuel.title=Stoking the Fires
embers.research.page.still_fuel.desc=The Brewing Still requires heat for all operations. This can simply be fire or an archaic lamp placed underneath the still, but the still will work very slowly if supplied this way. Alternatively, a Hearth Coil can be placed underneath the still instead, with the vessel sitting square in the middle of the coil. Distillation will be very quick this way, but expensive on Ember.

embers.research.page.distillation_pipe=Auxiliary Filter
embers.research.page.distillation_pipe.title=Double Distilled
embers.research.page.distillation_pipe.desc=As opposed to Hedge Alchemy, glowstone will not increase the power of booze effects. Instead, you found that adding an Auxiliary Filter upgrade enables the still to distill alcohol again and again, concentrating it. Concentration will remove particles from the effect, and can also increase the magnitude of the effect by 1. The downside is that after concentrating, the drink will be more alcoholic and more likely to make you tipsy...

embers.research.page.alchemy_dial=Alchemy Dial
embers.research.page.alchemy_dial.title=In-depth Analysis
embers.research.page.alchemy_dial.desc=Experienced brewers may analyse brewing outputs by instinct, but rookies are often left in the dust. This Alchemy Dial will help with that. Attaching it to a fluid tank containing a brew will identify all properties thereof. Considering the steep cost of this measurement device, more uses must surely exist... Perhaps they will reveal themselves soon.

embers.research.page.ale=Ale
embers.research.page.ale.title=Thanks Lucy
embers.research.page.ale.desc=Do you know why our ancestors stopped hunting the mammoth with stone swords? The answer is Ale, which made them powerful enough to just punch the poor animal to death with their bare hands. Drinking Ale will give you a stacking damage boost. This damage boost will stack up to 5 times, for up to +400%! However, when you take a hit while under the effects of Ale, you will also take extra damage.

embers.research.page.vodka=Vodka
embers.research.page.vodka.title=Na sdorówje!
embers.research.page.vodka.desc=Vodka is essentially the opposite of Ale. Instead of making you absurdly powerful, this drink will give you a stacking defense buff, but makes you dish out less damage in return. And before you're even thinking about it: No, this won't negate the negative effect of Ale.

embers.research.page.verdigris=Verdigris
embers.research.page.verdigris.title=Just Poison
embers.research.page.verdigris.desc=Verdigris is the nasty precursor to Absinthe. Drinking this is not good for you and you shouldn't do it. Perhaps you can find a different use for this nasty sludge... someday...

embers.research.page.absinthe=Absinthe
embers.research.page.absinthe.title=Blindness Not Included
embers.research.page.absinthe.desc=Absinthe is poison with sugary goodness. This drink really opens your inner eye and makes the world feel fuzzy. While under the effects of this brew, you will constantly accumulate experience points. Considering the kind of visions this gives you, going blind might have been preferable...

embers.research.page.methanol=Pyroligneous Spirit
embers.research.page.methanol.title=Firebreather
embers.research.page.methanol.desc=Alcohol is flammable. This drink barely qualifies as a real drink, it's more of a weapon. Chugging this will really make you sick, but on the upside, if you spit it out in time through the open flame of a held torch, you can basically breathe fire.

embers.research.page.inner_fire=Inner Fire Ale
embers.research.page.inner_fire.title=Local Man Too Drunk To Die
embers.research.page.inner_fire.desc=Oh, du lieber Augustin. This drink really packs a fiery punch. When you consume this drink, for a brief time you become almost immune to fire damage. Additionally, if you strike an enemy while under this effect, you will deal extra fire damage as if you had a weapon enchanted with Fire Aspect.

embers.research.page.snowpoff_vodka=Snowpoff Vodka
embers.research.page.snowpoff_vodka.title=Snowball Fight
embers.research.page.snowpoff_vodka.desc=Continuing the trend of defensive effects, this specialized cousin of ordinary Vodka will envelop the drinker in frost and snow. Upon taking damage while under this effect, your body will erupt into several snowballs that deal damage to enemies and knock them back.

embers.research.page.beetroot_soup=Beetroot Soup
embers.research.page.beetroot_soup.title=Beetroot Soup
embers.research.page.beetroot_soup.desc=Beetroot Soup. It's delicious and filling. This isn't really a drink, but it's not really a food either. It will fill your hunger like a food though, but it is rather bland. Maybe putting more ingredients in this would work?

embers.research.page.drinks=Drinks
embers.research.page.drinks.title=A Primer
embers.research.page.drinks.desc=There are a number of drinks available for brewing: Ale, which increases damage dealt and taken significantly; Potato Vodka, which does the opposite; Inner Fire Ale, which grants resilience to fire and flaming attacks; Absinthe, which rapidly grants inspiration at the cost of sanity; Snowpoff Vodka, which grants a form of icy thorns effect; and Wood Spirit, which allows the imbiber to spit fire using a torch.

embers.research.page.rename=Renaming
embers.research.page.rename.title=Fame and Glory
embers.research.page.rename.desc=Discerning which mug contains which brew can be quite difficult if you've created a large amount of different brews. To this end, you can be a bit more organized about your brewing. If a sign is attached on any side of the lower portion of the Still, the output of the Still will be named after what is written on the sign. This will be very useful for labelling your brews - and bragging I guess...

embers.research.page.lifedrinker=Lifedrinker
embers.research.page.lifedrinker.title=CR 25
embers.research.page.lifedrinker.desc=Lifedrinker is a modifier applicable to any alcohol. When a brew with Lifedrinker is consumed and an enemy is slain, it will grant 1 heart of extra health added to the maximum. All hearts gained by this effect wear off with the effect, but the effect can be lengthened by applying the modifier more often.

embers.research.page.steadfast=Steadfast
embers.research.page.steadfast.title=Speeding like a Hare
embers.research.page.steadfast.desc=Steadfast is a modifier applicable to any alcohol. When a brew with Steadfast is consumed, your speed will increase a bit. This stacks with regular speed, but comes at a drawback of making you more susceptible to knockback. The effect can be lengthened by applying the modifier more often.

embers.research.page.duration=Duration
embers.research.page.duration.title=Prolonging the Inevitable
embers.research.page.duration.desc=Just like in Hedge Alchemy, redstone has a prolonging effect on alcoholic brews. Applying this modifier increases the duration of all effects granted by the brew. The duration can further increase by applying this modifier several times. Be warned that redstone is a mercury or arsenic compound and will add a small amount of toxicity to your drink.

embers.research.page.purification=Purification
embers.research.page.purification.title=Curing Foolishness
embers.research.page.purification.desc=When adding some modifiers, due to the materials that are mixed into your brew, it may add a small amount of toxicity to it. Toxicity comes with unpleasant effects like nausea and vomiting. By adding prismarine crystals, some of the toxins are purged from the drink, making it safer to consume.

embers.research.page.healing=Healing
embers.research.page.healing.title=Greedy
embers.research.page.healing.desc=Adding Nether Wart to a drink will add a small bit of health recovery immediately when drunk. However, this effect is not free - the Nether Wart simply speeds up digestion, providing healing at the expense of hunger. Thus adding too many stacks of this modifier may cause you to starve when consuming the drink.

embers.research.page.cooling=Cooling
embers.research.page.cooling.title=Prevent Scalding
embers.research.page.cooling.desc=Some brews are quite hot and when drunk can cause scalding or even combustion. By adding small bits of ice to the drink, it can be cooled to safer levels.

embers.research.page.stew=Stewing
embers.research.page.stew.title=Boil em, Mash em, ...
embers.research.page.stew.desc=Beetroot Soup is good, but it's a little bland. Adding potatoes, carrots or other foods can make the soup more tasty and filling. Just beware that adding wheat, while filling, will drastically increase the time it takes to drink the soup.
