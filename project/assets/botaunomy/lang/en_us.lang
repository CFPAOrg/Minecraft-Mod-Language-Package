# -- DREAMWOOD AVATAR
botaunomy.entry.elven_avatar=Dreamwood Avatar
botaunomy.tagline.avatar=Superior rod handling!
botaunomy.page.avatar0=Carving some &1Dreamwood&0 and combining it with a &1Dragonstone&0 heart creates an upgraded avatar known as the &1Dreamwood Avatar&0. It's mana stores are vastly increased from the &1Livingwood Avatar&0 as are it's capabilities with handling rods.  It can use any rod the &1Livingwood Avatar&1 can wield plus specialized elven rods.
botaunomy.page.avatar1=The main purpose of the &1Dreamwood Avatar&0 is to use the &1Rod of Will&0.  This rod lets the avatar exert the will of the elves from Alfheim and interact with any block as if it were a person.  This rod can be synced with other items to be able to interact with any tool/item.  Consumables can be extracted from adjacent chests.
botaunomy.page.avatar2=Be sure to give this little guy a name.  He's practically a player!
