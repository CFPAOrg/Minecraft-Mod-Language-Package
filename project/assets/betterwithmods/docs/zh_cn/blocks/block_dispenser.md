The Block Dispenser is a Redstone controlled device with a multitude of uses.  
In the inventory of the Block Dispenser there is a highlighted slot that shows the current selected item. Given a full inventory, the selector will move over every slot 1 by one, changing after every redstone signal.

* The major usage of the Block Dispenser is its ability to break and place blocks in front of it.   
When it receives a signal it will place the currently selected block.    
When it loses that signal it will break the block in front of it.
