necronomicon.text.necronomicon.4=In order to unlock the knowledge, one must travel to said dimension and empower the Necronomicon with the flesh of that world. The Abyssalnomicon contains additional knowledge known only to J'zahar, knowledge man was not meant to obtain.


necronomicon.text.abyssalnomicon.1=This is the Abyssalnomicon, a book written by J'zahar, Gatekeeper of The Abyss. The book contains the knowledge of the 4 Necronomicons, as they are in fact chapters of this book. There is also extensive knowledge not mentioned in the others.
necronomicon.text.abyssalnomicon.2=As the knowledge about spells and rituals is limited to the specified dimension (and previous ones, depending on the Necronomicon type), the Abyssalnomcion has all knowledge collected in one place, with additions.

necronomicon.text.yog-sothoth.1=Yog-Sothoth, The Lurker at the Threshold, is an Outer God, and the offspring of the Nameless Mist.
necronomicon.text.yog-sothoth.2=It is heavily implied, if not outright stated, that Yog-Sothoth is omniscient, and is locked outside the universe, meaning he knows and can see all of space-time all at once, that there is no secret hidden from Yog-Sothoth.
necronomicon.text.shub-niggurath.1=Shub-Niggurath, The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young, is an Outer God in the pantheon.
necronomicon.text.shub-niggurath.2=She is a perverse fertility deity, said to appear as an enormous cloudy mass which extrudes black tentacles, slime-dripping mouths, and short, writhing goat legs. Small creatures are continually spat forth by the monstrosity, which are reconsumed or escape

necronomicon.text.cthulhu.2=He has the head of a octopus, and a scaly body with wings on his back. His state of endless sleep comes from a war against the Elder Beings, which ended with R'lyeh sinking to the bottom of the sea. One day he will rise to rule over the earth.

necronomicon.text.jzahar.1=J'zahar, Gatekeeper of The Abyss, is the bastard offspring of Hastur.
necronomicon.text.jzahar.2=Having a desire for power, and not wanting exile to the stars, J'zahar reached out beyond time and space to achieve his freedom. The results were similar powers to that of Yog-Sothoth, and the punishment of eternally guarding his imprisoned fellow deities.


necronomicon.text.greatoldones=Before the ages of man, the universe was ruled by a race of ancient demonic gods known as "The Great Old ones". Due to a conflict aeons ago, all of these beings are imprisoned far away where no man has ever set foot.
necronomicon.text.abyssalnomicon_info=The Abyssalnomicon is the unholy tome from which the Necronomicon was written, when J'zahar read that section to Alhazred.

necronomicon.text.dreadlands=Previously a world of Abyssalnite, the Dreadlands got it's name when the Dread Plague was unleashed on it, killing all miners and corrupting the peaceful Abyssalnite Golems. The second layer of the Abyss holds lost souls of the living.
necronomicon.text.omothol=A endless temple city built at the very edge of sanity. The Realm of J'zahar holds the only entrance to where The Great Old Ones dwell. The Gatekeeper is always watching, and nobody leaves the final layer of the Abyss alive.
necronomicon.text.darkrealm=Beneath Omothol lies the realm where the immortal souls of evil demonic gods rest, awaiting their reincarnation. The Dark Realm is where living shadows are born, and the last place a living souls should ever visit, as they will face eternal suffering.

necronomicon.text.materials.liquidcoralium.1=Liquid Coralium is a new liquid found within the Abyssal Wasteland. It has the ability to transmute elements on contact, as in converting any water-based liquid into itself, and most stone types into Abyssal Stone.
necronomicon.text.materials.liquidcoralium.2=It also infects entities that touches it with the Coralium Plague, killing them if they aren't immune. Some entities can be converted into Abyssal Zombies on death. If the liquid collides with Liquid Antimatter, it will convert into Coralium Stone.

necronomicon.text.materials.abyssalnitestone.1=Abyssalnite Stone is a stone found within the Purified Dreadlands biome inside the Dreadlands. You can turn it into Abyssalnite Stone Bricks.

necronomicon.text.materials.dreadlandsabyssalnite.1=Dreadlands Abyssalnite is a variant of Abyssalnite found in the Dreadlands. The ore gained from mining it can be smelted for Abyssalnite Ingots.

necronomicon.text.materials.omotholstone.2=
necronomicon.text.materials.ethaxium.1=Ethaxium is a new material most commonly appearing in Omothol as the material used for structures built there. Ethaxium is extremely hard, and can thus only be destroyed with tools made from it.
necronomicon.text.materials.ethaxium.2=Ethaxium is said to be what souls are made out of, which likely explains why it's almost indestructible. No wonder J'zahar built his temple city from this.
necronomicon.text.materials.darkethaxium.1=Dark Ethaxium is a stronger version of Ethaxium created by combining regular Ethaxium with Omothol Stone. This kind of Ethaxium is harder than it's normal counterpart.

necronomicon.text.rituals.5=When peforming, the pedestals project smoke towards the altar. Rituals where you gain objects always end with a bolt of lightning striking the altar.
necronomicon.text.rituals.6=Potential Energy is required in order to perform rituals (each ritual entry shows how much you need). Potential Energy is a pure form of untapped energy originating from a higher plane of existence. It's mainly used to fuel sacrifices made to The Great Old Ones (any ritual). Statues placed on Shoggoth Monoliths are said to be capable of draining it.


necronomicon.text.pe.1=Potential Energy (PE) is a new form of energy presented in AbyssalCraft. It originates from a higher plane of existence (where no mortal has wandered), and can only be collected by tapping into Ley Lines using various methods.

necronomicon.text.pe.5=It should be noted that you harvesting PE isn't appreciated. This causes disruptions to occur (displayed by a bolt of lightning striking the statue, or other PE manipulator). Disruptions are random events that can affect the player, other entities or the environment. Their purpose is to punish those who tries to drain PE from the higher plane.
necronomicon.text.pe.6=One way to boost the efficiency of statues (and other PE manipulators) is through the use of Ritual Charms. They can boost various stats (check the tooltip).
necronomicon.text.pe.7=You can also craft a Energy Pedestal, which can collect PE from statues (and other PE manipulators) that are placed 3 blocks from the pedestal.
necronomicon.text.pe.8=Along with the Energy Pedestal there's the Sacrificial Altar, which can convert life-force from dying entities into PE (targeted entities emit smoke).

necronomicon.text.pe.10=Upon reaching Omothol, you will be able to create deity-specific Ritual Charms (with an Abyssalnomicon), or buy them from Remnant Priests. Those charms will give an additional boost if used on manipulators associated with the same deity as the one displayed on the charm.

necronomicon.text.machines.1=The Transmutator is used to transmute objects into other objects, which can revert a process or simply convert an object into it's opposite. It's fueled by any Coralium materials, Coralium-plagued Flesh and any Crystallized element (full crystal or shard).
necronomicon.text.machines.2=The Crystallizer is used to crystallize elements, isolating the base elements (or molecules) they're made from. It's fueled by any Dreaded material, Dread Fragments and any Crystallized element (full crystal or shard).
necronomicon.text.machines.3=The Engraver is used to engrave coins, allowing you to trade things with Remnant. The "fuel" used in engraving is engraving templates, that wear out after a certain amount of uses. If you want to re-engrave a coin, you have to use a blank engraving on it first (to un-engrave it).
necronomicon.text.machines.4=The Materializer is used to create objects by combining base elements (obtained through crystallization). The Materializer uses no fuel, but requires a Necronomicon to function, and a Crystal Bag with crystals to materialize objects from.
