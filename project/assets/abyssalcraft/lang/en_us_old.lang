necronomicon.text.entity.shuboffspring.2=These beasts can rarely be found in forests (most common in Roofed Forests and Darklands Forests). You know you're getting close to one if you start hearing sheep out of nowhere. You're most likely to encounter one at night during a new moon.

necronomicon.text.rituals.info=Check the information section for information regarding rituals, or the other sections for information about available rituals. "Location" specifies where the ritual can be performed.

necronomicon.text.rituals.1=In order to get started with rituals you need to create the altar to perform them at. There is a total of 8 materials you can create your Ritual Altar from.
necronomicon.text.rituals.2=Those are: Cobblestone, Darkstone Cobblestone, Abyssal Cobblestone, Coralium Cobblestone, Dreadstone Cobblestone, Abyssalnite Cobblestone, Ethaxium Brick and Dark Ethaxium Brick. The materials can only be used in their specific dimension (eg. Cobblestone and Darkstone Cobblestone in the Overworld, Abyssal Cobblestone in the Abyssal Wasteland etc).
necronomicon.text.rituals.3=To create the altar, simply place the blocks in the above formation (keep the colored area clear) and shift right-click the center block with a Necronomicon.
necronomicon.text.rituals.4=After that, you can start performing rituals! In order to perform a ritual, place objects on the pedestals and shift right-click the altar with a Necronomicon.
necronomicon.text.rituals.5=When performing, the pedestals project bits of their placed object towards the altar. Rituals where you gain objects always end with a bolt of lightning striking the altar.
necronomicon.text.rituals.6=Potential Energy is required in order to perform rituals (each ritual entry shows how much you need). Potential Energy is a pure form of untapped energy originating from a higher plane of existence. It's mainly used to fuel sacrifices made to The Great Old Ones (any ritual). Statues placed on Shoggoth Monoliths are said to be capable of draining it.
necronomicon.text.rituals.7=Some rituals require a living sacrifice. This means you need to have an adult animal within close proximity of the altar and pedestals. When the ritual starts, the target animal will begin to emit smoke particles, and needs to die before the ritual ends. Failing to complete a ritual will trigger a Disruption, which is bad.

necronomicon.text.pe.1=Potential Energy (PE) is a new form of energy presented in AbyssalCraft. It originates from a higher plane of existence (where no mortal has wandered), and can only be collected by tapping into Ley Lines using various methods. There exist objects capable of doing so, which will be explained here.
necronomicon.text.pe.2=A good place to start obtaining materials required to create some of the PE collecting objects is Shoggoth Lairs, found in swamps and rivers.
necronomicon.text.pe.3=Shoggoth Monoliths are also constructed with Monolith Stone (hence the name), while having statues placed on them. These statues can collect PE.
necronomicon.text.pe.4=It should be noted that the Lesser Shoggoths only build these monoliths under certain conditions. Theorists claim it has to do with power positions (but they're genderless, and don't understand the concept of hieracrchy). If 6 (or more) Lesser Shoggoths are within 32 blocks of each other, one is prone to rise a monolith out of the ooze.
necronomicon.text.pe.5=You should take into account that the Lesser Shoggoths have no limit on how many monoliths they construct, leading to a possible infestation.
necronomicon.text.pe.6=If you notice Shoggoth activity near your homestead, it is highly advised that you immediately evacuate your land, or construct a large wall (or other defensive measures) to ensure the infestation doesn't spread onto your land. Recovering your land from a Shoggoth infestation is quite difficult, so be cautious.
necronomicon.text.pe.7=The statues come in different shapes, all depicting Great Old Ones. They can transport PE to nearby players holding Necronomicons when under open sky.
necronomicon.text.pe.8=It should be noted that you harvesting PE isn't appreciated. This causes disruptions to occur (displayed by a bolt of lightning striking the statue, or other PE manipulator). Disruptions are random events that can affect the player, other entities or the environment. Their purpose is to punish those who tries to drain PE from the higher plane.
necronomicon.text.pe.9=Statues have a limited PE transfer range to nearby collectors. Collectors need to be placed in the yellow frame (with a two block gap between it and the statue).
necronomicon.text.pe.10=When placed on Monolith Stone Pillar Blocks, the statues range can be increased up to two blocks. Statues on pillars can transfer energy to Collectors further down.
necronomicon.text.pe.11=An Energy Depositioner is another PE manipulator. It works like a generator, where the "fuel" are Stone Tablets charged with PE.
necronomicon.text.pe.12=One way to boost the efficiency of statues (and other PE manipulators) is through the use of Ritual Charms. They can boost various stats (check the tooltip).
necronomicon.text.pe.13=You can also craft an Energy Pedestal, which can collect PE from statues (and other PE manipulators). Items that can hold PE can be placed on the pedestal to charge.
necronomicon.text.pe.14=Along with the Energy Pedestal there's the Sacrificial Altar, which can convert life-force from dying entities into PE (targeted entities emit smoke).
necronomicon.text.pe.15=Another way to collect PE from manipulators is with an Energy Collector. It works like an Energy Pedestal (except you can't place items on it).
necronomicon.text.pe.16=Energy Relays are used to transfer PE, and can do so in any direction (but it can't transport it through solid blocks, except glass).
necronomicon.text.pe.17=Building networks with Energy Relays allows you to transport PE over larger distances. Energy Relays can drain PE from PE Collector placed next to it.
necronomicon.text.pe.18=In order to store greater amounts of PE, you can create an Energy Container. They allow insertion through Energy Relays or interaction with the block.
necronomicon.text.pe.19=If the PE production still is too slow, you can also upgrade the various PE handling blocks through infusion rituals to boost stats.
necronomicon.text.pe.20=Upon reaching Omothol, you will be able to create deity-specific Ritual Charms (with an Abyssalnomicon), or buy them from Remnant Priests. Those charms will give an additional boost if used on manipulators associated with the same deity as the one displayed on the charm.

necronomicon.text.machines.info=Check the information section for information regarding the different machines, or the other sections for all recipes for the specified machine. The recipes aren't sorted in any way.

necronomicon.text.machines.1=The Transmutator is used to transmute objects into other objects, which can revert a process or simply convert an object into it's opposite. It's fueled by any Coralium materials, Coralium-plagued Flesh and any Crystallized element (full crystal or shard).
necronomicon.text.machines.2=The Crystallizer is used to crystallize elements, isolating the base elements (or molecules) they're made from. It's fueled by any Dreaded material, Dread Fragments and any Crystallized element (full crystal or shard).
necronomicon.text.machines.3=The Engraver is used to engrave coins, allowing you to trade things with Remnant. The "fuel" used in engraving is engraving templates, that wear out after a certain amount of uses. If you want to re-engrave a coin, you have to use a blank engraving on it first (to un-engrave it).
necronomicon.text.machines.4=The Materializer is used to create objects by combining base elements (obtained through crystallization). The Materializer uses no fuel, but requires a Necronomicon to function, and a Crystal Bag with crystals to materialize objects from.

necronomicon.text.knowledge.1=Some information in this book is incomprehensible to your puny, regular, untwisted mortal mind. By studying artifacts, listening to the whispers from statues, defeat monsters and explore the surroundings, you can expand your mind with new knowledge, enabling you to comprehend the information. Some Items and Blocks also require knowledge in order to be comprehended.
necronomicon.text.knowledge.2=Treasure chests can contain lost pages with information, and in old structures scattered about, you can uncover murals that will grant you knowledge. Statues depicting Great Old Ones can sometimes be heard whispering things. Through combat you can gain knowledge of the enemy after defeating it. Exploring biomes and dimensions will grant you new knowledge.
necronomicon.text.knowledge.3=Information you can't comprehend appears in Aklo glyphs rather than the human alphabet. The following page has an example of such glyphs:

necronomicon.text.coraliumplague.1=The Coralium Plague is a disease originating from the Abyssal Wasteland. It's capable of transforming infected victims on death into stronger monsters. It's only considered a plague by those harmed by it.
necronomicon.text.coraliumplague.2=An antidote for the Coralium Plague can be made with a Water Bottle, a Wasteland's Thorn, a piece of Anti-Plagued Flesh and a piece of Abyssal Shoggoth Flesh.

necronomicon.text.dreadplague.1=The Dread Plague is a disease originating from the Dreadlands. It's a very infectious disease, swiftly travelling between hosts, but also transforming the ground around those afflicted by it, thus allowing the plague to grow stronger. The only place known to be completely immune to the Dread Plague is Omothol.
necronomicon.text.dreadplague.2=An antidote for the Dread Plague can be made with a Water Bottle, a Dreadlands Sapling, a Dread Fragment and a piece of Dreaded Shoggoth Flesh.

necronomicon.text.placesofpower.info=Structures of devotion appeasing the Great Old Ones, allowing for safe PE generation.

necronomicon.text.placesofpower.1=Places of Power are shrine-like structures built to show devotion to the Great Old Ones. These sites of worship spread the word of the Great Old Ones, while also enabling harvesting of PE without disruptions. Along with the safe retrieval of energy, these structures can also boost various stats of the statues contained in them.
necronomicon.text.placesofpower.2=In the structures section you can view the structures you've gained knowledge on how to build, their dimensions and what stats they amplify (if any). The point where you form the structure (by sneak right-clicking it with your Necronomicon) will change block in the preview to indicate where it is.

necronomicon.text.spells.info=Check the information section for information regarding spells, or the compendium for available spells.

necronomicon.text.spells.1=In order to get started with spells you need to obtain some scrolls to inscribe the spells onto. Most of the available scrolls (except the greater) can be created through rituals or bought from Remnants. Spells in the compendium show which scroll they require (if the center slot is empty you can use any scroll).
necronomicon.text.spells.2=Currently the quality of the scroll used has no impact on the inscribed spell, but in a future update some aspects of a spell will improve depending on which scroll you use. The unique scrolls will likely do something beyond that.
necronomicon.text.spells.3=Spellcasting is done by right-clicking while holding an inscribed scroll (you also need an item that holds PE in your inventory for the casting to tap into). If the spell type is "Charging", you need to hold down the mouse button for 3 seconds, otherwise it's instant. Depending on the spell, you might need to target something specific while casting.

necronomicon.text.wip=This section is incomplete.
