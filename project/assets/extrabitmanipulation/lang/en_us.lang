jei.description.chiselsandbits:block_bit=Press Extra Bit Manipulation's Throw Bit key binding (default: R) to throw bits like snowballs. They can be deployed from vanilla dispensers, as well. Upon block collision, they place in the world, if possible. If not possible (or if thrown at entities) they drop as items.\nIf not disabled via config, bits with a material of lava ignite blocks/entities and bit with a material of water extinguish them. Throwing a water bit at a Blaze will damage it.


jei.description.extrabitmanipulation:designs=Press Extra Bit Manipulation's Edit Chisel Design key binding (default: R) to see the block states in the design, preview the result up-close, and to remove bits or replace bits with different bits.


jei.description.extrabitmanipulation:bit_wrench=This wrench can§l rotate§r,§l mirror§r,§l translate§r, or§l invert§r chiseled blocks from Chisels & Bits by right clicking them.\n\nHold the §nChisels and Bits radial menu key§r to change tool settings.\n\nScrolling the mouse wheel while sneaking will cycle through the four modes:\n\n§l§nRotation§l\nClockwise if not sneaking, counter-clockwise if sneaking.\n\n\n§l§nMirroring§l\nFront-to-back if not sneaking, left-to-right if sneaking.\n\n§l§nTranslation§l\nAway from you if not sneaking, towards you if sneaking.\n\n\n§l§nInversion§l\nInverts all bits regardless of whether or not you are sneaking.


jei.description.extrabitmanipulation:sculpting=These sculpting wires and spades remove/add cuboidal, ellipsoidal, cylindrical, conic, or pyramidal areas of bits from chiseled/chiselable blocks.\n\nHold the §nChisels and Bits radial menu key§r to change tool settings.\n§l§nSpades§r\n\n§nLeft click§r blocks to add areas of bits.\n\n§nShift left click§r blocks to set the bit type to add.\n\n\n§l§nWires§r\n\n§nLeft click§r blocks to remove areas of bits.\n\n§nShift left click§r blocks to set the bit type to remove (clicking nothing clears selection, i.e. remove anything).\n§nRight click§r to cycle §lmode§r:\n\n§l1) Drawn§r - click a point on a block and release on another point to alter bits of all chiseled/chiselable blocks intersecting a cuboidal, ellipsoidal, rectangular, or elliptic shape.\n§l2) Global§r - click a point on a block to alter bits of all chiseled/chiselable blocks intersecting a cubic, spherical, square, or circular shape.\n\n§l3) Local§r - click a point on a block to alter bits of that clicked block.\n§nShift scroll§r the mouse wheel to change the removal area radius.\n\n§nControl right click§r to change sculpting shape.\n\n§nControl left click§r to toggle between targeting bits and targeting bit grid vertices (for local/global modes).\n\n§nControl scroll§r the mouse wheel to cycle through sculpting shapes.\n\n§nX right click§r to toggle shapes hollow or solid.\n§nX left click§r to toggle ends of hollow shapes open or closed.\n\n§nX scroll§r the mouse wheel to change wall thickness of hollow shapes.


jei.description.extrabitmanipulation:modeling_tool=This modeling tool can create chiseled block models of areas of blocks in the world. Hold the §nChisels and Bits radial menu key§r to change tool settings.\n\n§nLeft click§r blocks to read areas of blocks (up to 16^3 meters). See the tooltip for more specific information about this area, as it is mode-dependent.\n\n§nRight click§r a block to spawn on it a chiseled block model of the read area.\n\n§nShift right click§r to open mapping/preview GUI.\n§nShift scroll§r the mouse wheel to cycle §larea mode§r:\n\n§l1) Centered§r - click block to read a 16^3 m area centered on the nearest block grid vertex (block corner).\n\n\n§l2) Corner§r - click block to read a 16^3 m area with closet corner on the nearest block grid vertex (block corner).\n\n§l3) Drawn§r - click a block and release on another block to read all blocks within the enclosed area.\n§nControl right click§r to toggle whether bit mapping GUI opens upon reading an area.\n\n§nControl scroll§r the mouse wheel to cycle §lchunk snap mode§r:\n\n§l1) Off§r - the area does not snap at all.\n§l2) XYZ§r - the area snaps in the X and Z axes, as described above, and additionally snaps in the Y axis to the 'vertical chunk' (as visualized by pressing F3 + G) the block the player is looking at is in.\n\n\n§l3) XZ§r - the area snaps in the X and Z axes (Y axis is unaffected) to whichever chunk the block the player is looking at is in.


jei.description.extrabitmanipulation:chiseled_armor=Chiseled armor pieces allow any number of items (not just item blocks - any items) to be rendered for every moving part of an armor piece.\n\nHold the §nChisels and Bits radial menu key§r to change tool settings.\n§nLeft click§r blocks to set the area that represents the bodypart associated with the moving part that blocks will be added to.\n\n§nShift left click§r blocks to do so and fill that area with bodypart template blocks (which will be ignored when importing bits of blocks into the armor piece).\n\n§nControl right click§r to toggle §lmode§r:\n\n§l1) Template Creation§r - click a block to create an area that orients imported blocks in reference to an armor piece's moving part.\n\n§l2) Block Collection§r - click a point on a block and release on another point to import copies of all interesting bits into an armor piece's moving part.\n§nControl scroll§r the mouse wheel to cycle the scale at which imported blocks will render as.\n\n(since actual blocks in the world don't change size, the bodypart template reference area will get larger for scales smaller that 1:1)\n§nX right click§r to toggle the collection mode targets between blocks and bits, where the defined area will be from one block/bit to another block/bit.\n\n\n\n§nX scroll§r the mouse wheel to cycle the selected moving part of an armor piece. The selected moving part is what collected blocks are imported into, and also dictates the type of bodypart template collection area rendered/used.


jei.description.extrabitmanipulation:bodypart_template=The bits of this block are ignored by armor pieces when importing bits in collection mode. This gives a solid surface to place bits on when creating the armor models.\n\n\n\nSetting the bodypart template area with an armor piece in block collection mode will additionally fill the area with bits of this block.
