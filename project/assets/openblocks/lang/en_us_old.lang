Backup is created when:\n - player dies\n - grave is spawned \n - player issued command §L/ob_inventory store§R\n\nTo restore inventory you need backup name. Go to folder below or to saves folder on server and look for files named §Linventory-*.dat§R. Then restore inventory with §L/ob_inventory restore <player> <id>§R - where id is either full filename or just middle part, without §Linventory-§R and §L.dat§R. You can also use tab completion.
