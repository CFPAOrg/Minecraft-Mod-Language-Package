Aqueducts can be used to transfer water over long distances. The Aqueduct block must be placed as a channel with a rim at least 1 block high. The rim need not be made from aqueduct blocks.
Water can be input from any source block. This includes water sources created by screwpumps. To input into the aqueduct, a water source block must flow directly onto an aqueduct block. Aqueducts are occasionally temperamental and filling it can sometimes take a short while.
There is a maximum distance water can flow downstream an aqueduct, usually ![128](var:betterwithaddons:aqueduct_length) blocks. Water can be stepped up using screwpumps or stepped down one block at a time as long as there's another aqueduct block to flow into. (a 4 block waterfall may look cool, but is not supported)
Aqueducts will be emptied if the source is blocked upstream. Boats and items can normally travel down Aqueducts.

Aqueducts do not contain real source blocks, but water can be picked up from the aqueduct with the usual containers.
