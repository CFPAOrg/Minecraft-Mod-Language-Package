# Rope Bridges

![Rope Bridges](betterwithaddons:ropebridge.png)

Rope Bridges are mostly decorative, but can also serve as horizontal scaffolding or simple bridges to cross ravines and gaps.
To create a rope bridge, rope can be attached to fenceposts. When two posts are lined up and right-clicked with rope, they will automatically be connected, consuming rope proportional to the distance between them.
After a rope has been spanned between two posts, planks can be added by right-clicking the rope with planks in hand, again requiring one block per segment covered. Rope without planks cannot be walked on by entities.
Breaking rope with planks on it will return the planks. Cutting one rope segment or breaking either of the connected posts will break the whole length of rope.

There may be other blocks that rope can be attached to in this way, like [Scaffolds](scaffold.md).
