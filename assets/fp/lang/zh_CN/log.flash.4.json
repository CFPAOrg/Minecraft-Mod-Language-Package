	"Currently the biggest problem of my flashdrive is that every storage cell requires a seperate control signal for reading and writing. With my newest development I was able to eliminate this problem. I now use a glowtite crystal as storage unit that changes his structure under targeted exposure and hence his refractive behaviour. For reading and writing at a storage location I use a very special laser where Retium is showing the best frequency spectrum for this application.",
