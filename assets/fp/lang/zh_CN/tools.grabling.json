	"Pitons need edges in the landscape to be securely able to hold me up. As a solution, I developed climbing slime. Instead of throwing a piton, the rope is attached to a sticky ball of slime. A neon impulse that is transferred through the rope can suppress the stickiness of the slime for a short time to release it from a wall.",
