	"With the help of my deadly lasers, I have developed a type of guard tower. With the help of a built-in computer, it automatically targets all creatures within its range. With a very strong laser beam, the guard tower will rapidly injure targets.",
	"In doing so, the tower consumes large amounts of neon energy, which is why I should connect it to a more permanent source of energy. In addition to the continuous consumption of the computer monitoring system, the killing of an entity requires additional energy (10 NE per life point).",
