{b}Introduction to Dimension Building
{n:intro}
Always wanted to create your own worlds? Explore uncharted areas and
create magnificent buildings in fabulous worlds? With the Dimension
Builder you create your own dimensions with all kinds of special
features. Make void worlds, mining ages, floating islands, ...

There is one catch, though. Dimensions require power to run (RF). Simple
dimensions like a void world don't require a lot of power (10-200 RF/tick)
but very complex dimensions can easily go above millions RF/tick. So if
you want a world made out of diamond blocks you're either going to have
to be very lucky or else be prepared for a hefty power generation system.

RFTools generates dimensions with random features. However, you can make 
things more deterministic by specifying every type of dimlet.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimension Theory
{n:theory}
Before embarking on the adventure of forming your own worlds, it is
important to understand how the dimensions work.

The first thing that is important to understand is that worlds you
create are not necessarily unique. If a pattern of code is used to
create one world, using the same pattern of code will create the
same world again. In fact, when you enter the first world and make
changes, the changes will appear in the second as well!

This allows you to disassemble dimensions, but enter the same exact
ones later with the changes you've made still there, provided
you used the exact same code.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimlets - Coding the World
{n:unknown}
Dimensions, when created normally, will be completely random. You have
no way of knowing whether it will be a floating sky world or a huge
cave, or whether it's midnight or mid-day. Although you have a chance
of creating a good world, chances are it won't work out in your favour.

However, you can control your world with objects called Dimlets.
Scattered throughout the world, in dungeons and other chests, or just
obtained by killing Endermen, you have a chance of finding dimlet
parts. These small items were made a long time ago with forgotten
technology and can be used to construct dimlets. These dimlets are
similar to code - imagine each dimlet as its own line of code;
modifying the next dimlet or defining something about the world.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Dimlets are complicated devices, filled with advanced circuitry
and powerful essences. These things can literally define how a
world works. Most of the work you will be doing with dimensions
will involve these dimlets.

If you ever find yourself running low on dimlets, there is a
higher chance of finding them within your custom dimensions.
So, when nearly out of dimlets, create a couple random worlds
and look around for interesting structures - you may find some
very valuable dimlets in there.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}There are currently 14 types of dimlets discovered:
    Terrain Dimlets: These are used to define what a world looks
        like. Some examples include a normal world, a flat world,
        or a skylands world.
    Digit Dimlets: Digit Dimlets are lines of code that can be used
        to create different dimensions. This allows you to create
        new, unique worlds, except with exactly the same dimlets.
    Biome Dimlets: These control what biomes appear in a dimension.
        How many biomes are supported depends on the controller.
    Biome Controller: These determine how many and which type of 
        biomes are selected. For instance, you could define it
        so that there is only one biome, or a checkerboard of
        biomes.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
    Material Dimlets: These dimlets are used to define what a feature is
        made out of. For instance, these can be used to make sure a world
        is made out of Glowstone or a tendril is made out of Netherrack.
        When used as a modifier for a another dimlet, the cost of
        these dimlets will drastically increase, same as the liquid
        dimlets.
    Liquid Dimlets: Similar to Material Dimlets, these only differ in
        the fact that they define a liquid instead of a solid material.
    Feature Dimlets: These dimlets define what features appear in the
        world, such as floating ores filled with liquids, increased
        ore generation, or even tendrils of various substances.
    Structure Dimlets: These define if certain structures will appear in
        the world, such as strongholds, villages, or mineshafts.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
    Mob Dimlets: Using these dimlets you can specify additional mobs that
        should spawn in your world (in addition to normal mob spawning!).
    Sky Dimlets: These allow you to define the colours, sizes, or even
        existence of various objects in the sky, such as planets, moons,
        suns, sky colour, fog colour, and more.
    Time Dimlets: With these dimlets you can control the time of the day.
        It can be set to either a fixed time (morning, evening, midnight,
        noon) or else you can get slow or faster time.
    Weather Dimlets: Control the weather in your dimension with these
        dimlets.
    Effect Dimlets: These dimlets add various special effects. Negative 
        effects generally help reduce maintenance power.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
    Special dimlets: These are special dimlets that are usually
        extremely rare.

{b}There are currently five special dimlets:
    Peaceful Dimlet: This dimlet prevents hostile mobs from
        spawning in your dimension (except for mobs that you
        manually add using mob dimlets). It is an expensive
        dimlet though, and it will also never be randomly
        generated in dimensions that you create.
    Efficiency Dimlet: If you add this rare dimlet to your
        dimension tab then the dimension will consume 20% less
        energy per tick. This effect is cumulative. However,
        it will greatly increase the creation time and
        creation cost.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
    Mediocre Efficiency Dimlet: This dimlet functions as a
        somewhat inferior version of the Effeciency Dimlet.
        It is easier to obtain, but does not add quite the
        effects the normal Effeciency Dimlet does.
    Shelter Dimlet: A dimlet for dimensions that may be
        excessively hostile, this dimlet creates a much
        safer spot for teleporting in.
    Seed Dimlet: A very specialized dimlet to control the seed
        of the random world generation for a dimension.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimlet Crafting
{n:create}

Now that you have your dimlet parts you need a way to make
dimlets. Using the Dimlet Workbench you can deconstruct
dimlets into their technical components and then reconstruct
them into new dimlets.

The workbench can be crafted as follows:
{rb:dimlet_workbench}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Every dimlet is made out of six parts:
    - Dimlet Base item
    - Dimlet Control Circuit
    - Dimlet Energy Module
    - Dimlet Memory Module
    - Dimlet Type Controller
    - Essence item

You need the right tier of every part to make a dimlet.
There is one control circuit for every rarity (0 to 6) and there
are three levels of the energy and memory modules.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
When extracting dimlets into parts there is a 40% chance for
every part that you get nothing. To avoid this it is recommended
that you infuse the workbench. A maximum infused workbench will
guarantee that you get all parts back.

Extracting a dimlet will never give you an essence item. You
always have to make that.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
There are various kinds of essence items depending on the type
of dimlet that you want to make:
    - Biome Absorber for biome dimlets
    - Material Absorber for material dimlets
    - Liquid Absorber for liquid dimlets
    - Time Absorber for time dimlets
    - Syringe for mob dimlets
    - Peaceful essence (made out of 9 filled syringes of a
      specific type) for the peaceful dimlet
    - Efficiency/mediocre efficiency items for the corresponding
      efficiency dimlets
    - Structure Essence (from villagers) for structure dimlets
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
So, if you wanted to create a Biome: Forest dimlet, you would
place the Biome Absorber within a Forest Biome. Slowly, the
Biome Absorber will fill up with the essence of the Forest Biome.
You can then place it in the last slot of the Dimlet Workbench
along with the other pieces of the dimlet to build your Biome:
Forest dimlet, now ready to be used in any dimensions!

For the Time Absorber you need to give the absorber a redstone
signal at approximately the right time. This has to be done
10 times before it has fully absorbed the time.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Note that some dimlets can be crafted using the regular crafting
table.

You may notice that some of these craftable dimlets require a
weird item. This is a Dimlet Template which can be crafted as
follows:
{ri:dimlet_template}

To craft this you actually need dimensional shards.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimension Enscriber
{n:enscriber}
The Dimension Enscriber is what is used to actually code your dimensions.
{rb:dimension_enscriber}
In addition, you will also need a Empty Dimension Tab
{ri:empty_dimension_tab}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
To use the Dimension Enscriber, you must first insert the Empty
Dimension Tab into the slot on the lower left. To make a completely
random world (with no dimlets included), you can simply click
"Store" and the dimlets included will be randomly selected.

However, if you would like to actually control your dimension, you
need to insert dimlets. These can be inserted into the slots on
the top of the device. Hitting store will create a realised tab
that leads to the world you've just created.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
The order of the dimlets inserted affects the dimension. If a material
dimlet is placed before a terrain dimlet, it will create a world made
out of that material. If it is inserted before a feature dimlet, it will
make the feature out of that material.

The descriptions of each type of dimlet and what they do can be found in the
{l:unknown}Dimlet Page.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
When you create a dimension, the dimlets placed into that dimension form
the signature of the dimension. Any tabs created with those exact dimlets
will lead to that world. Dimension Tabs can be extracted in the Enscriber
to return the dimlets used. If access to that dimension is needed again,
the same dimlets can be re-formed into a dimension to lead to that exact
dimension, with any changes you've made still there.

Further information about the theory behind dimensions can be found on the
{l:theory}Dimension Theory page.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
However, some people may wish to create new dimensions with the same
set of dimlets. This can be easily done using Digit Dimlets. These
have no power cost and allow you to infinitely vary your dimensions,
just based on the digit dimlets included. Digit dimlets can be easily
crafted and cycled between, so it is easy to vary your worlds.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Each dimlet has a certain Maintenance, Creation, and Tick cost shown
in the tooltip. These represent the power cost of a dimension created
with those dimlets. The Creation cost represents how much power the 
dimlet will need per tick when creating the dimension. The Tick 
cost represents how many ticks that dimlet will add to the creation 
of the dimlet. The Maintenance cost is simply how much the dimlet 
will cost per tick after the world is created.

The maintenance cost can be lowered using Efficiency Dimlets, making
it easier to maintain an already created world.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimension Builder
{n:builder}
The Dimension Builder is what is used to create dimensions and maintain
them based on the Realised Tab
{rb:dimension_builder}

Depending on the complexity of the dimension it will use power and need
some time to actually construct the dimension. If there is not enough
power present the building will be delayed. You can also take out your
dimension tab if you want to temporarily stop building the dimension (if
you need power for something else for example). The dimension tab will
remember the current progress.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
As soon as the dimension is ready the tooltip on the dimension tab
will change indicating the status and current power. You will also
notice that the energy level of the dimension builder is suddenly
emptied. That's because all current energy in the dimension builder
is immediately given to the dimension. The dimension itself has a
buffer of 40,000,000 RF. Don't attempt to go to your dimension if
there is not yet enough energy in it. Wait until sufficient energy
has been put in it (you can see the current level in the tooltip
of the dimension tab).

Hint: If you shift-right click with the dimension tab in your hand
you can see what random features were selected for creating this
dimension.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Note on powering very expensive dimensions: the dimension builder
accepts a maximum of 50,000 RF/tick on every side. So at most it can
get 300,000 RF/tick if you input energy from all six sides and if
you have conduits or energy cells that can handle that amount of
RF/tick (a tesseract would work). Sometimes even 300,000 RF/tick
is not enough to power your dimension. In that case you can use
multiple dimension builders and multiple (identical) dimension tabs.
That does mean that you will need multiples of all the dimlets that
you used to create that dimension tab as well.

Hint: the Special Efficiency dimlet and the Mediocre Effeciency
dimlet both help with reducing maintenance cost but will add a
greater creation cost and tick cost.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Getting There and Safety
{n:teleport}

Once you have created your dimension you will need a way to get there. To 
do that you have to use the RFTools teleportation system. At the time the
dimension is created the Dimension Builder also generated a spawn platform
with a Matter Receiver in the middle. This Matter Receiver will be fully
charged so it is safe to teleport there.

After creating the dimension you will need a Dialing Device to dial a matter
transmitter to that new destination. If you gave your realised dimension tab a
name (in the enscriber) then that destination will also be named like that.

But don't just teleport to there yet! There are a few things you should
worry about:
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Power!
Your Dimension Builder is feeding power into the dimension. As
long as that builder is chunkloaded or you are near it all is fine.
But as soon as you teleport to that other dimension the dimension
builder may become unloaded at which point no new energy will be
entered in the dimension. The dimension will from that point on
run on internal power. Depending on how expensive the dimension is
you can live in a non-powered dimension for a considerable time.
But beware of power running out! You will die if power is completely
gone, but before that happens the dimension will darken and you will
get various bad effects.

Also note that if you have a dimension that uses a lot of RF/tick
this internal buffer will go down a lot faster.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
To solve this problem you either have to make sure your dimension
builder is chunkloaded or else take with you another dimension
builder with a copy (or the original) realized dimension tab and
some power (a battery or generator) so that you can keep sending
power from inside the dimension itself.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Getting Back

While the Dimension Builder generates a Matter Receiver in the dimension
there will not be a Matter Transmitter! So you have to bring your own way
back with you. You can do this with various teleportation systems but the
recommended way is to use a Matter Transmitter that you bring with you.
There are two options:

Put the matter transmitter in your main base, fully power it and dial
it to a nearby matter receiver. Then pick it up with a wrench. It
will keep the settings so when you put it down in the other dimension it
will still have power and you will be able to get back with it. Keep in mind 
that power in that transmitter is drained with every teleport, so you will 
have to be careful next time you go into the dimension.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Best is to bring along a battery or generator as well.
Otherwise take some power, the matter transmitter and another
dialing device with you and simply set up a teleportation hub in
the dimension. If all fails you can simply go back by dying. You
will return at your spawn point (but without your inventory of course).
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
If you are in the dimension then there is one handy tool that you
can bring with you to monitor the power status of the dimension
and that's the Dimension Monitor that you can craft like this:
{ri:dimension_monitor}

Right clicking with this tool will show you the amount of power
still left in the dimension. The tool also gives a visual indication
of the current amount of power.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Major Failure!
{n:failure}
What if you just died in an unpowered dimension? How can you get your
stuff back? Sometimes you really need to go back to a dimension that
has no power. The Phased Field Generator allows you to do just that:

{ri:phased_field_generator}

This item has be charged first. While it has enough power it will protect you
from the hazards of an unpowered dimension. But be fast (as fast as you can
with the slowness you will get) because power runs out quickly!
This item has to be in your hotbar to work. Do *not* remove it!
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimensional Shards
{n:shards}
Certain machines and items require an odd essence called "Dimensional
Shards." Probably produced as a byproduct of the energy fueled into
these dimensions. Generating below level 40, these shards will appear
in any RFTools Dimension. This ore can be mined with a pickaxe to
return the shards, which can then be used for all manner of things.

{b}Dimensional Shards have several uses:
    Firstly, shards are required to craft some of the basic dimlets.
    You also need some shards to craft the 'Machine Infuser,' 'Activity
    Probe', and 'Dimlet Templates.'
    And finally, you can use them to 'infuse' almost all RFTools machines to
    make them more efficient or give them special abilities.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Machine Infuser
{n:infuser}
RFTools has the 'Machine Infuser' which is crafted as follows:
{rb:machineInfuserBlock}

With this machine you can inject dimensional shards into almost all other
RFTools machines. Just pick up any RFTools machine with a wrench and put
it in the left slot of the infuser. You can infuse up to 256 shards into a 
single machine. Infused machines work more efficiently or faster. The benefits 
vary depending on the machine, but in almost all cases it will need a lot less
power to operate and in some cases the speed will greatly increase.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
One particular use case is the Dimension Builder. A fully infused Dimension
Builder will create dimensions a lot faster and use less energy. But also
the shield block, auto crafter, and so on will benefit from this.

It is also very useful to infuse your Matter Transmitter and Matter
Receiver blocks as that way they will work faster and use a lot less
energy (making them safer to use).
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Activity Probe
{n:probe}

Normally dimensions use power constantly - even when nobody is in
them. It is possible to make this a bit more efficient by making
an Activity Probe. You can craft this block as follows:
{rb:activity_probe}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
This device is passive. It doesn't use any power and it has no user
interface either. You simply place it in an RFTools dimension (it
has no effect in any other dimension). While it is present in a
dimension it monitors activity in that dimension and it will shut
down power consumption from that dimension when nobody is in the
dimension (including chunk loaders). So this block is an effective
way to make sure your dimension isn't using power needlessly.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Energy Extractor
{n:extractor}

With this block it is possible to extract energy back out of
a dimension. You can use this in case you no longer want to
use the dimension or perhaps you have a central hub where you
pump a lot of energy in your dimension and then you can use this
block to distribute power everywhere. Be careful to not let
the dimension run dry!
{rb:energy_extractor}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimension Editor
{n:editor}

With the Dimension Editor you can alter already created dimensions
by inserting some types of dimlets. It can be crafted as follows:
{rb:dimension_editor}

Note that inserted dimlets are lost during this process (you will not get
it back even if you deconstruct the dimension tab) and you pay the full
power cost for it. There is no way to undo this so be careful. This can
only be done with dimlets of type 'special', 'mob', 'effect',
'sky', 'weather', and 'time'.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
In addition to injecting some types of dimlets you can also inject
a pre-charged matter receiver. This can be handy in case you
accidently broke your receiver or it failed to generate because
some structure overwrote it (AE2 meteors tend to do that for
example).
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimension Monitor
{n:monitor}

Besides the dimension monitor item there is also a dimension monitor
block which sends out a redstone signal as soon as the power in
the current dimension goes below a certain level. It can be
crafted as follows:
{rb:dimension_monitor}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
