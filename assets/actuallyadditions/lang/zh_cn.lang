booklet.actuallyadditions.chapter.bookSplitting.text.1=The <item>Atomic Reconstructor<r> has the ability to split books with multiple enchantments into more books, with only a single enchantment each. This costs <imp>155000 CF<r>, so you will only ever be able to split a single book at a time. Be careful to not leave multiple books in the path of the reconstructor, or it might hit one with only a single enchantment, <imp>voiding 155000 CF<r>! As a side effect, this process generates enchanted books out of thin air to fulfill it's purpose. Magic, right?
