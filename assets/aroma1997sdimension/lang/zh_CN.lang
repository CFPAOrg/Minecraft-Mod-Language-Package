book.aroma1997sdimension:introduction=Welcome to your new Aroma1997s Dimensional World User Manual! This manual covers all the blocks and their functions from the mod.


book.aroma1997sdimension:general.1=Aroma1997s Dimensional World is a mod that allows you to create a dimension where you can mine peacefully and not worry about quarry holes destroying your terrain.
book.aroma1997sdimension:general.2=This User Manual will not automatically update itself between versions. To update it manually just place it into a crafting grid.
book.aroma1997sdimension:general.3=If you don't know the recipes of the Chest, Bag or the Upgrades, install NEI. The Crafting recipes won't be shown here.

book.aroma1997sdimension:blocks.1=This part of the book lists the blocks in the mod and their respective functions.

book.aroma1997sdimension:blocks.portalFrame=Portal Frame: This block is the structure block for the portal to and from the Mining Dimension.
book.aroma1997sdimension:blocks.stickyOre=Sticky Ore: Have you ever wondered where to get slimeballs in Peaceful? Well, here's your solution. Sticky Ore is fairly rare, but if you mine it, you will get slimeballs. This ore is affected by Fortune.
book.aroma1997sdimension:blocks.minerCore=Miner Core: This is the most important block of the Miner. It houses the resonating quantum processors that control the mining process by simultaneously using all of the Miner Blocks in the structure.
book.aroma1997sdimension:blocks.filler=Miner Filler Block: This is the main structure component of the Miner. Also used in crafting recipes.
book.aroma1997sdimension:blocks.generator=Miner Generator: If you are just starting out or you don't have any power generation mods, this is the block that will power your miner using everything you can burn in a furnace. Just Right-Click on it to open it's GUI and put fuel in.
book.aroma1997sdimension:blocks.miner=Miner Block: Does the mining for you! Another Miner structure component.
book.aroma1997sdimension:blocks.interface=Miner Export Interface: This block outputs everything the Miner mines into an inventory or a pipe. Has to be on the outside of the structure.
book.aroma1997sdimension:blocks.enchant=Miner Enchantment Interface: If you want to upgrade your Miner, this is where you will have to put enchanted books in. Accepts only one enchantment per block.
book.aroma1997sdimension:blocks.rf=Miner Power Acceptor: This block accepts Redstone Flux power and powers the Miner.

book.aroma1997sdimension:items.1=This chapter lists the items from the mod.

book.aroma1997sdimension:items.portalIgniter=Mining Multitool: This item is used in crafting and to light the portal to the Mining World.
book.aroma1997sdimension:items.dimensionChanger=DimensionChanger: If you are lost in the Mining World or just lazy, just hold Right-Click with this item in your hand to teleport from/to the Mining World almost instantly.

book.aroma1997sdimension:setupPortal.1=You are probably wondering how can you get to the Mining World. It's very simple! Craft the Portal Blocks, arrange them in the same shape you would make a Nether Portal, and ignite the bottom blocks with the Mining Multitool.
book.aroma1997sdimension:setupPortal.2=If the Portal does not form, fill the inside of the structure with any blocks, break them, and then light the Portal again WITHOUT stepping into the structure.

book.aroma1997sdimension:setupMiner.1=If you are tired of mining manually, this part of the book will tell you how to set up your very own Aromic Miner!
book.aroma1997sdimension:setupMiner.2=For the most basic version of the miner, you have to get these blocks: 1x Miner Core, 1x Miner Generator, 1x Miner Block, 1x Miner Export Interface, and 14x Miner Filler Blocks. You need to arrange these blocks in a 3x3x2 structure with the Miner Core in the bottom middle.
book.aroma1997sdimension:setupMiner.3=If you have done everything correctly, the miner should turn green. Now you can place some fuel in the Miner Generator, place a chest next to the Export Interface, and start Mining!
book.aroma1997sdimension:setupMiner.4=Note: The Miner mines everything below it and replaces everything except air with Cobblestone. So if you don't want to destroy your base, don't put the Miner above it.
book.aroma1997sdimension:setupMiner.5=The Miner doesn't cause any block updates, so don't worry if your Nether Portal gets in the way. It'll mine the Obsidian, but leave the Portal fully functional.
