{b}Introduction
{n:intro}
XNet is all about networking and transporting items, liquids, energy
and information through the world. Using cables you connect various
machines and blocks and in the controller you configure how things
move through the created network. A cable can send all kinds of
information. You don't need different cables for items, energy, or liquids.

XNet is also very efficient and scalable. Cables are not tile entities
and you can create huge cable networks without performance differences.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Basic Networking
{n:basic}
A network (or local network) is represented by a number of machines
and blocks connected using cables and connectors and one controller.
Every network needs one controller (and not more) and it is the block
that does the actual work.

On a single network you can have up to eight channels for items, liquids,
energy, and information. You can configure these channels in the UI of the
controller.

Every channel can be connected to as many blocks and machines as
you want using connectors.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Advanced Networking
{n:advanced}
Using routers one can connect multiple networks. A single router
can connect up to 6 networks (one for each side). To do that simply
connect the network to the router using a normal connector.

Channels are only visible to the router if they are named. This can
be done in the UI of the controller. These channels are called
'named channels'.

A named channel can then be published in the router by giving it
a 'published name'. Only then can this channel be used by other
networks (either local or remote).
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Channel Types
{n:types}
There are currently four different channel types:
  * xnet.item: for transporting items
  * xnet.energy: for transporting energy
  * xnet.fluid: for transporting fluids
  * xnet.logic: for sensors and logic control

The logic channel is special. It allows you to create sensors to
measure various things in other blocks (like number of items,
amount of energy, ...) and then set a 'color' on the controller.

Note that the logic channel doesn't do anything through a router
right now.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Network Color
{n:netcolors}
Using a logic channel and sensors you can enable or disable
seven different colors in a controller. Basically a color is
a boolean value that can be either on or off. You can use these
colors in connections from all channel types to disable or
enable a connection. Every connection can listen to four
different colors and will only work if any set (non-black)
color is enabled.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Colored Cables
{n:colors}
Cables and connectors can have four different colors. Do not
confuse these colors with network colors from the previous
section! These cable colors allow you to place distinct
networks right next to each other without them connecting.

There is also a 'fifth' color which is for the routing cables
and connectors.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Connectors
{n:connector}
A connector is a part of the cable that can be used to connect
to a machine. Placing a connector will automatically make a
connection to any suitable block around it. Note that a connector
in itself is not sufficient to do something. You need to actually
create a connection in the controller.

The advanced connector has more speed, and can also access
the block from other sides then the one you are physically
connecting too.

Note that in the GUI of a connector you can give it a name to make
it easier to identify connectors in the controller.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Controller (part 1)
{n:controller}
{rb:controller}
The controller is the main driver of a network. Every network
needs one controller. It also needs power. In the GUI of the
controller you can create up to 8 different channels with a
given type. Then for each connected block on that channel you
can create a connection. Depending on the type of the channel
there are various parameters you can set on a connection.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Controllers (part 2)
Hint: it is often handy to disable a channel while you are
working on it so that things don't start moving too soon. This
can be done in the channel editor section.

Note that in that section you can also give the channel a name.
This is only needed for advanced networking using routers.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Router (part 1)
{n:router}
{rb:router}
The router is the block that can be used to connect distinct
networks. On its own it can connect six different networks
(one networks per side) but using routing cables you can also
make a routing network and connect multiple routers.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Router (part 2)
In the GUI of the router you can see all named channels in all
local networks (this is why it can be important to be able to
name channels in the contoller). To make such a channel available
to the routing network you need to 'publish' it. To do that
you give it a global name in that list.

All published channels of the same type and with the same published
name will automatically connect. That means that a controller
extracting items (from one of its locally connected blocks) will
be able to insert items into all blocks connected locally or in
connected channels from other networks.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Router (part 3)
On the right side of the GUI you can see all published channels
from remote routers. Again channels connect automatically to them
if they have the same type and name.

Note that this only goes one step. If you have router A connected
to router B and router B connected to router C then networks on
router A can not see networks on router C. Even if they have the
same published name.

Also note that there is a limit of 32 published channels on a
routing network.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Redstone Proxy
{n:orixt}
{rb:redstone_proxy}
The Redstone Proxy block is a very simple block that has no
functionality on its own. It is special because connectors can
also connect to it which allows you to access the redstone
properties of it in a sensor. Using a sensor in a logic channel
you can read out the amount of redstone going into the proxy block.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
