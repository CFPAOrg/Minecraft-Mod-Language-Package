{b}Resonating Ore
{n:ore}
Deep under the ground a good miner can occasionally find resonating
ore. If you do then this can be your start to a big adventure.

If you melt this ore you get resonating plates which are used as base
for many crafting recipes in this mod.

But the main usage for this ore is melting it in the smelter to generate
the Resonating Crystal Liquid (RCL).
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Resonating Crystals
{n:crystals}
Very rarely you can find a resonating crystal in a deep cave. Collect these
crystals. They have low power and low purity but they can be useful for
early game power. Just place them near a correctly formed generator.

Note that crystals explode heavily if there is a nearby explosion (like
from a creeper). Be careful! The power of this explosion depends on the
power that is in the crystal as well as the strength of this crystal.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Crystal Attributes
{n:attributes}
Every crystal has four basic characteristics:

    * Strength: this is the inherent strength of a crystal. The stronger
      a crystal is the more power it can contain. This goes from 0% to
      100% but in the future you will be able to 'overcharge' crystals
      for even more power (and even more danger).
    * Efficiency: this represents how efficient this crystal is at
      producing power. i.e. a higher efficiency means a higher RF/tick.
    * Purity: this represents how clean the crystal is. Low purity crystals
      will cause more radiation and are less efficient at producing power.
    * Power: this is the actual power that is still left in this crystal.
      It is represented as a percentage of the total possible power that
      this crystal has.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Radiation
{n:radiation}
A running generator will produce radiation. The amount of radiation as
well as the power of this radiation depends on the power of the crystal
as well as the purity of it. A 100% pure crystal that is not overcharged
will generate very little radiation.

Naturally spawned crystals are not pure but because they contain little
power they don't cause a lot of radiation. So you can use them for early
game power.

Turning off a generator will not immediatelly stop the radiation. Depending
on the strength of the radiation it will take a while before it completely
disappears.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Radiation Monitor
Using the radiation monitor you can measure how much radiation there
is in a certain area:
{ri:radiation_monitor}
Obsidian helps to block some of the radiation but dense obsidian is even
better. You can also use lead blocks. These are better then obsidian but
not as good as dense obsidian. Dense glass is about as good as lead.

A radiation suit also helps. If you have a complete set then nearly
95% of the radiation will be prevented.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Radiation Module
If RFTools is installed you can also use a radiation sensor block
and a radiation screen module to display the amount of radiation at
a given pointon an RFTools screen.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Machine Frame
{n:frame}
Nearly everything in this mod requires a machine frame as a basic
crafting ingredient:
{rb:machine_frame}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Generator Block
{n:generator}
To generate power you need a generator multiblock. The basis of this block
is the generator which you craft as follows:
{rb:generator}

A single block supports up to 2 crystals and maximum 10KRF/tick. If you
need to handle more or more powerful crystals you will have to add blocks
to your generator. A generator can be any shape. It doesn't have to be
rectangular.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Energy Collector
{n:collector}
The generator on its own cannot get the power out of the crystals. For that
you need one energy collector on top of the generator multiblock. Only
one collector can be put on a single generator multiblock. You can make
this collector as follows:
{rb:energy_collector}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Generator Controller
{n:controller}
The generator can only work if it is turned on. You can do that with
the generator controller:
{rb:generator_controller}

To turn on the generator simply give this block a redstone signal.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Resonating Crystal Liquid
{n:rcl}
When you place resonating ore in the smelter it will produce RCL.
This liquid is the crucial ingredient for growing your own crystals. The
quality of the final crystal will depend on the attributes of this liquid:

{l:rclquality}Quality
{l:rclpurity}Purity
{l:rclstrength}Strength
{l:rclefficiency}Efficiency
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}RCL Quality
{n:rclquality}
Only liquids with 100% quality can be grown into the best crystals.
Quality is determined in the smelter. Only with the right amount of lava (tank
about half full) will you produce optimal quality RCL. Putting too much lava
in the tank will make the smelting process too hot which introduces impurities
in the liquid.

Note that there is no way to increase quality later so it is very important
that you get quality right from the first step.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}RCL Purity
{n:rclpurity}
The purity of the liquid determines how much radiation and pollution you
will get when generating power from a crystal. It is important to try to get
the purity as high as possible. In addition, crystals with higher purity will
generate more power at a higher RF/t as well.

With the right amount of lava the smelter will produce liquid with only 10%
purity so you need to use the purifier to improve purity.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}RCL Strength
{n:rclstrength}
The strength of the liquid determines how much power in total this
crystal will be able to generate. The smelter will always produce
liquid with strength 10%.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}RCL Efficiency
{n:rclefficiency}
The efficiency of the liquid determines how efficient the
generated crystal will be able to produce its power. In other words,
the higher the efficiency, the better the RF/tick. The smelter
will always produce liquid with efficiency 10%.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Tank
{n:tank}
{rb:tank}
The tanks from Deep Resonance have room for 16 buckets of liquid.
If you place multiple tanks connected to each other they will form a
multiblock capable of holding more liquid. They are normal tanks so they
can contain liquids of any mod but they have special support for RCL as
they can mix incoming RCL with the liquid that is already there. For
example, adding 50% purity liquid to a tank containing already 40% purity
liquid will slightly increase the overall purity of the liquid in the tank.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Right clicking a face of the tank will toggle between three modes:
none, accept, and provide. This is not needed for sides that are
connected to machines of this mod (smelter, crystalizer, ...) as
they will automatically connect to the tank.

Placing a comparator next to the tank will allow detecting if
the tank is filled between 40 and 60%. This helps for automating
the correct filling of the lava tank under the smelter.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Smelter
{n:smelter}
{rb:smelter}
To use the smelter you need a tank below it filled with lava and a tank
above it which will be filled with RCL. In addition you need to give the
smelter power and supply it with resonating ore (either with automation
or by inserting it in the user interface).

The smelter works best with the lava tank filled between 40 and 60%. More
lava will increase the operation speed but if you use too much lava the
quality of the RCL will decrease.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Purifier
{n:purifier}
{rb:purifier}
With the purifier you can enhance the purity of the liquid. To do this you
need filter material which you can insert into the purifier. Put the tank of
RCL that you want to purify above the purifier and another tank below it.
The purifier can only purify up to 85% purity and will do so in steps of 25%.
When the filter material is used up it will be ejected in an nearby inventory
if possible. The purifier can also work with a single tank on top or below it.

Note that if the quality of the liquid is not very good you may not
be able to purify it as high as 85%.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Lens and Laser
{n:laser}
{rb:laser}
{rb:lens}
With the laser and the lens you can improve the quality of the liquid
in a tank even more then what the purifier can do.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
The lens has to be placed on the tank and the laser facing the lens.
So you have the laser, one empty space, the lens and finally the tank.

The laser needs power, spent (or unspent) crystals. Finally you also
need some kind of catalyst item (emerald, diamond, redstone, glowstone,
...). Then give the laser a redstone signal and it will start improving
the liquid.

Be careful though! The laser does not test if the tank actually has
enough liquid in it (500mB) and if the liquid is actually valid liquid
that can be infused. So be careful not to waste precious materials here.

Warning! Make sure you don't infuse purity below 0% as that
will destroy a lot of the liquid
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Note that the laser does infuse 500mB per catalist item. By default
the following catalysts are supported: diamond, emerald, ender pearl,
redstone, gunpowder, glowstone, blaze powder, quartz, nether star,
ghast tear, slime ball and coal. You can see what bonuses a catalyst
has in the GUI of the laser (just turn off the laser and put the
catalyst in the slot).
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Valve
{n:valve}
{rb:valve}
The valve is an advanced filter that can measure various attributes
of the RCL liquid in a tank above it and if these attributes are
better then specific values it will move liquid to the bottom tank.
Using the valve you can make a purifier setup using a single purifier
where you loop the RCL back through the same tank and then use the
valve to extract the liquid when it has sufficient purity.
The valve can also make sure the bottom tank has not more then
a certain amount of RCL liquid in it.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Crystalizer
{n:crystalizer}
{rb:crystalizer}
The crystalizer needs to be placed on top of a tank filled with RCL. It
will consume the liquid in that tank and form a crystal out of it. The
crystalizer also needs power.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Pedestal
{n:pedestal}
{rb:pedestal}
The pedestal can automatically place crystals in front of it. It will
also break crystals if they are used up and try to place them in an
adjacent inventory. If it can't find one it will eject it into the
world instead.
Once the crystal is placed it will be automatically connected to the
closest generator (if that generator allows it).
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
